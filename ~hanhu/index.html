                                <p>Recent advances in photogrammetry, especially that of Semi-Global Matching (SGM),
                                    have raised a huge renaissance in image based modeling. Moreover through the
                                    powerful and innovated penta-view aerial oblique images, we can reconstruct the same
                                    building (object) from multiple views with details and textures on the facades. But
                                    processing this kind of dataset is a non-trivial work, compared to the traditional
                                    aerial nadir images. A lot of works have been devoted to this area, but it's still
                                    an open question and under active researches. The whole processing steps from the
                                    oblique images to the 3D models in different level-of-details (LOD) is quite
                                    complex, and to be simply said, it majorly includes some points on the right. </p>

                                                <h4>Abstract</h4>

                                                <p>Semi-global matching (SGM) is essentially a discrete optimization for
                                                    the disparity value of each pixel, under the assumption of disparity
                                                    continuities. SGM overcomes the influence of the disparity
                                                    discontinuities by a set of parameters. Using smaller parameters,
                                                    the continuity constraint is weakened, which will cause significant
                                                    noises in planar and textureless areas, reflected as the
                                                    fluctuations on the final surface reconstruction. On the other
                                                    hands, larger parameters will impose too much constraints on
                                                    continuities, which may lead to losses of sharp features. To address
                                                    this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive dense stereo matching
                                                    methods for airborne images using with texture information. Firstly,
                                                    the texture is quantified, and under the assumption that disparity
                                                    variation is directly proportional to the texture information, the
                                                    adaptive parameters are gauged accordingly. Second, SGM is adopted
                                                    to optimize the discrete disparities using the adaptively tuned
                                                    parameters. Experimental evaluations using the ISPRS benchmark
                                                    dataset and images obtained by the SWDC-5 have revealed that the
                                                    proposed method will significantly improve the visual qualities of
                                                    the point clouds.</p>

                                                <p>RGB-D sensors (sensors with RGB camera and Depth camera) are novel
                                                    sensing systems that capture RGB images along with pixel-wise depth
                                                    information. Although they are widely used in various applications,
                                                    RGB-D sensors have significant drawbacks including limited
                                                    measurement ranges (e.g., within 3 m) and errors in depth
                                                    measurement increase with distance from the sensor with respect to
                                                    3D dense mapping. In this paper, we present a novel approach to
                                                    geometrically integrate the depth scene and RGB scene to enlarge the
                                                    measurement distance of RGB-D sensors and enrich the details of
                                                    model generated from depth images. First, precise calibration for
                                                    RGB-D Sensors is introduced. In addition to the calibration of
                                                    internal and external parameters for both, IR camera and RGB camera,
                                                    the relative pose between RGB camera and IR camera is also
                                                    calibrated. Second, to ensure poses accuracy of RGB images, a
                                                    refined false features matches rejection method is introduced by
                                                    combining the depth information and initial camera poses between
                                                    frames of the RGB-D sensor. Then, a global optimization model is
                                                    used to improve the accuracy of the camera pose, decreasing the
                                                    inconsistencies between the depth frames in advance. In order to
                                                    eliminate the geometric inconsistencies between RGB scene and depth
                                                    scene, the scale ambiguity problem encountered during the pose
                                                    estimation with RGB image sequences can be resolved by integrating
                                                    the depth and visual information and a robust rigid-transformation
                                                    recovery method is developed to register RGB scene to depth scene.
                                                    The benefit of the proposed joint optimization method is firstly
                                                    evaluated with the publicly available benchmark datasets collected
                                                    with Kinect. Then, the proposed method is examined by tests with two
                                                    sets of datasets collected in both outside and inside environments.
                                                    The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness
                                                    of the proposed method.</p>

                                                <h4>Abstract</h4>

                                                <p>Textureless and geometric discontinuities are major problems in
                                                    state-of-the-art dense image matching methods, as they can cause
                                                    visually significant noise and the loss of sharp features. Binary
                                                    census transform is one of the best matching cost methods but in
                                                    textureless areas, where the intensity values are similar, it
                                                    suffers from small random noises. Global optimization for disparity
                                                    computation is inherently sensitive to parameter tuning in complex
                                                    urban scenes, and must compromise between smoothness and
                                                    discontinuities. The aim of this study is to provide a method to
                                                    overcome these issues in dense image matching, by extending the
                                                    industry proven Semi-Global Matching through 1) developing a ternary
                                                    census transform, which takes three outputs in a single order
                                                    comparison and encodes the results in two bits rather than one, and
                                                    also 2) by using texture-information to self-tune the parameters,
                                                    which both preserves sharp edges and enforces smoothness when
                                                    necessary. Experimental results using various datasets from
                                                    different platforms have shown that the visual qualities of the
                                                    triangulated point clouds in urban areas can be largely improved by
                                                    these proposed methods.</p>

                                                <p>RGB-D sensors are novel sensing systems that capture RGB images along
                                                    with pixel-wise depth information. Although they are widely used in
                                                    various applications, RGB-D sensors have significant drawbacks with
                                                    respect to 3D dense mapping of indoor environments. First, they only
                                                    allow a measurement range with a limited distance (e.g., within 3 m)
                                                    and a limited field of view. Second, the error of the depth
                                                    measurement increases with increasing distance to the sensor. In
                                                    this paper, we propose an enhanced RGB-D mapping method for detailed
                                                    3D modeling of large indoor environments by combining RGB
                                                    image-based modeling and depth-based modeling. The scale ambiguity
                                                    problem during the pose estimation with RGB image sequences can be
                                                    resolved by integrating the information from the depth and visual
                                                    information provided by the proposed system. A robust
                                                    rigid-transformation recovery method is developed to register the
                                                    RGB image-based and depth-based 3D models together. The proposed
                                                    method is examined with two datasets collected in indoor
                                                    environments for which the experimental results demonstrate the
                                                    feasibility and robustness of the proposed method

                                                <p>Improving the matching reliability of low-altitude images is one of
                                                    the most challenging issues in recent years, particularly for images
                                                    with large viewpoint variation. In this study, an approach for
                                                    low-altitude remote sensing image matching that is robust to the
                                                    geometric transformation caused by viewpoint change is proposed.
                                                    First, multiresolution local regions are extracted from the images
                                                    and each local region is normalized to a circular area based on a
                                                    transformation. Second, interest points are detected and clustered
                                                    into local regions. The feature area of each interest point is
                                                    determined under the constraint of the local region which the point
                                                    belongs to. Then, a descriptor is computed for each interest point
                                                    by using the classical scale invariant feature transform (SIFT).
                                                    Finally, a feature matching strategy is proposed on the basis of
                                                    feature similarity confidence to obtain reliable matches.
                                                    Experimental results show that the proposed method provides
                                                    significant improvements in the number of correct matches compared
                                                    with other traditional methods.

                                                <h4>Abstract</h4>

                                                <p>During the last decade the use of airborne multi camera systems
                                                    increased significantly. The development in digital camera
                                                    technology allows mounting several mid- or small-format cameras
                                                    efficiently onto one platform and thus enables image capture under
                                                    different angles. Those oblique images turn out to be interesting
                                                    for a number of applications since lateral parts of elevated
                                                    objects, like buildings or trees, are visible. However, occlusion or
                                                    illumination differences might challenge image processing. From an
                                                    image orientation point of view those multi-camera systems bring the
                                                    advantage of a better ray intersection geometry compared to
                                                    nadir-only image blocks. On the other hand, varying scale, occlusion
                                                    and atmospheric influences which are difficult to model impose
                                                    problems to the image matching and bundle adjustment tasks. In order
                                                    to understand current limitations of image orientation approaches
                                                    and the influence of different parameters such as image overlap or
                                                    GCP distribution, a commonly available dataset was released. The
                                                    originally captured data comprises of a state-of-the-art image block
                                                    with very high overlap, but in the first stage of the so-called
                                                    ISPRS/EUROSDR benchmark on multi-platform photogrammetry only a
                                                    reduced set of images was released. In this paper some first results
                                                    obtained with this dataset are presented. They refer to different
                                                    aspects like tie point matching across the viewing directions,
                                                    influence of the oblique images onto the bundle adjustment, the role
                                                    of image overlap and GCP distribution. As far as the tie point
                                                    matching is concerned we observed that matching of overlapping
                                                    images pointing to the same cardinal direction, or between nadir and
                                                    oblique views in general is quite successful. Due to the quite
                                                    different perspective between images of different viewing directions
                                                    the standard tie point matching, for instance based on interest
                                                    points does not work well. How to address occlusion and ambiguities
                                                    due to different views onto objects is clearly a non-solved research
                                                    problem so far. In our experiments we also confirm that the
                                                    obtainable height accuracy is better when all images are used in
                                                    bundle block adjustment. This was also shown in other research
                                                    before and is confirmed here. Not surprisingly, the large overlap of
                                                    80/80% provides much better object space accuracy – random errors
                                                    seem to be about 2-3fold smaller compared to the 60/60% overlap. A
                                                    comparison of different software approaches shows that newly emerged
                                                    commercial packages, initially intended to work with small frame
                                                    image blocks, do perform very well.</p>

                                                <h4>Abstract</h4>

                                                <p>Least-squares matching is a standard procedure in photogrammetric
                                                    applications for obtaining sub-pixel accuracies of image
                                                    correspondences. However, least-squares matching has also been
                                                    criticized for its instability, which is primarily reflected by the
                                                    requests for the initial correspondence and favorable image quality.
                                                    In image matching between oblique images, due to the blur,
                                                    illumination differences and other effects, the image attributes of
                                                    different views are notably different, which results in a more
                                                    severe convergence problem. Aiming at improving the convergence rate
                                                    and robustness of least-squares matching of oblique images, we
                                                    incorporated prior geometric knowledge in the optimization process,
                                                    which is reflected as the bounded constraints on the optimizing
                                                    parameters that constrain the search for a solution to a reasonable
                                                    region. Furthermore, to be resilient to outliers, we substituted the
                                                    square loss with a robust loss function. To solve the composite
                                                    problem, we reformulated the least-squares matching problem as a
                                                    bound constrained optimization problem, which can be solved with
                                                    bounds constrained Levenberg–Marquardt solver. Experimental results
                                                    consisting of images from two different penta-view oblique camera
                                                    systems confirmed that the proposed method shows guaranteed final
                                                    convergences in various scenarios compared to the approximately
                                                    20–50% convergence rate of classical least-squares matching.</p>

                                                <p>Combined bundle adjustment is a fundamental step in the processing of
                                                    massive oblique images.
                                                    Traditional bundle adjustment designed for nadir images gives
                                                    identical weights to different parts of
                                                    image point observations made from different directions, due to the
                                                    assumption that the errors in the
                                                    observations follow the same Gaussian distribution. However, because
                                                    of their large tilt angles, aerial
                                                    oblique images have trapezoidal footprints on the ground, and their
                                                    areas correspond to conspicuously
                                                    different ground sample distances. The errors in different
                                                    observations no longer conform to the above
                                                    assumption, which leads to suboptimal bundle adjustment accuracy and
                                                    restricts subsequent 3D applications.
                                                    To model the distribution of the errors correctly for the combined
                                                    bundle adjustment of oblique
                                                    images, this paper proposes an asymmetric re-weighting method. The
                                                    scale of each pixel is used to determine
                                                    a re-weighting factor, and each pixel is subsequently projected onto
                                                    the ground to identify another
                                                    anisotropic re-weighting factor using the shape of its quadrangle.
                                                    Next, these two factors are integrated
                                                    into the combined bundle adjustment using asymmetric weights for the
                                                    image point observations;
                                                    greater weights are assigned to observations with fine resolutions,
                                                    and those with coarse resolutions
                                                    are penalized. This paper analyzes urban and rural images captured
                                                    by three different five-angle camera
                                                    systems, from both proprietary datasets and the ISPRS/EuroSDR
                                                    benchmark. The results reveal that the
                                                    proposed method outperforms the traditional method in both
                                                    back-projected and triangulated precision
                                                    by approximately 5–10% in most cases. Furthermore, the misalignments
                                                    of point clouds generated by the
                                                    different cameras are significantly alleviated after combined bundle
                                                    adjustment.</p>

                                                <p>High-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) and airborne light detection
                                                    and ranging (LiDAR) data are widely used for deriving 3D spatial
                                                    information. However, the 3D spatial information derived from them
                                                    in the same area can be inconsistent. Considering HRSI and LiDAR
                                                    datasets taken from metropolitan areas as a case study, this paper
                                                    presents a novel approach to the geometric integration of HRSI and
                                                    LiDAR data to reduce their inconsistencies and improve their
                                                    geopositioning accuracy. First, the influences of HRSI’s individual
                                                    rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) on geopositioning accuracies
                                                    are analyzed and the RPCs that dominate those accuracies are
                                                    identified. The RPCs are then used as inputs in the geometric
                                                    integration model together with the tie points identified in stereo
                                                    images and LiDAR ground points. A local vertical constraint and a
                                                    local horizontal constraint are also incorporated in the model to
                                                    ensure vertical and horizontal consistency between the two datasets.
                                                    The model improves the dominating RPCs and the ground coordinates of
                                                    the LiDAR points, decreasing the inconsistencies between the two
                                                    datasets and improving their geopositioning accuracy. Experiments
                                                    were conducted using ZY-3 and Pleiades-1 imagery and the
                                                    corresponding airborne LiDAR data in Hong Kong. The results verify
                                                    that the geometric integration model effectively improves the
                                                    geopositioning accuracies of both types of imagery and the LiDAR
                                                    points. Furthermore, the model enables the full comparative and
                                                    synergistic use of remote sensing imagery and laser scanning data
                                                    collected from different platforms and sensors.</p>

                                                <p>This paper proposes a reliable feature point matching method
                                                    for oblique images using various spatial relationships and
                                                    geometrical information for the problems resulted by the
                                                    large view point changes, the image deformations, blurring,
                                                    and other factors. Three spatial constraints are incorporated
                                                    to filter possible outliers, including a cyclic angular ordering
                                                    constraint, a local position constraint, and a neighborhood
                                                    conserving constraint. Other ancillary geometric information,
                                                    which includes the initial exterior orientation parameters
                                                    that are obtained from the platform parameters and a
                                                    rough DEM, are used to transform the oblique images geometrically
                                                    and reduce the perspective deformations. Experiment
                                                    results revealed that the proposed method is superior
                                                    to the standard SIFT regarding both precision and correct

                                                <h4>Abstract</h4>

                                                <p>This paper proposed a quick, affine invariance matching method for
                                                    oblique images. It calculated the initial affine matrix by making
                                                    full use of the two estimated camera axis orientation parameters of
                                                    an oblique image, then recovered the oblique image to a rectified
                                                    image by doing the inverse affine transform, and left over by the
                                                    SIFT method. We used the nearest neighbor distance ratio(NNDR),
                                                    normalized cross correlation(NCC) measure constraints and
                                                    consistency check to get the coarse matches, then used RANSAC method
                                                    to calculate the fundamental matrix and the homography matrix. And
                                                    we got the matches that they were interior points when calculating
                                                    the homography matrix, then calculated the average value of the
                                                    matches' principal direction differences. During the matching
                                                    process, we got the initial matching features by the nearest
                                                    neighbor(NN) matching strategy, then used the epipolar constrains,
                                                    homography constrains, NCC measure constrains and consistency check
                                                    of the initial matches' principal direction differences with the
                                                    calculated average value of the interior matches' principal
                                                    direction differences to eliminate false matches. Experiments
                                                    conducted on three pairs of typical oblique images demonstrate that
                                                    our method takes about the same time as SIFT to match a pair of
                                                    oblique images with a plenty of corresponding points distributed
                                                    evenly and an extremely low mismatching rate.</p>

                                                <p>Aiming at solving the problem of fracture at the discontinuities area
                                                    and the challenges of line fitting in each partition, an innovative
                                                    line extraction algorithm is proposed based on phase grouping using
                                                    overlapped partition. The proposed algorithm adopted dual partition
                                                    steps, which will generate overlapped eight partitions. Between the
                                                    two steps, the middle axis in the first step coincides with the
                                                    border lines in the other step. Firstly, the connected edge points
                                                    that share the same phase gradients are merged into the line
                                                    candidates, and fitted into line segments. Then to remedy the break
                                                    lines at the border areas, the break segments in the second
                                                    partition steps are refitted. The proposed algorithm is robust and
                                                    does not need any parameter tuning. Experiments with various
                                                    datasets have confirmed that the method is not only capable of
                                                    handling the linear features, but also powerful enough in handling
                                                    the curve features.</p>

                                                <p>Detection of the damaged building is the obligatory step prior to
                                                    evaluate earthquake casualty and economic losses. It's very
                                                    difficult to detect damaged buildings accurately based on the
                                                    assumption that intact roofs appear in laser data as large planar
                                                    segments whereas collapsed roofs are characterized by many small
                                                    segments. This paper presents a contour cluster shape similarity
                                                    analysis algorithm for reliable building damage detection from the
                                                    post-earthquake airborne LiDAR point cloud. First we evaluate the
                                                    entropies of shape similarities between all the combinations of two
                                                    contour lines within a building cluster, which quantitatively
                                                    describe the shape diversity. Then the maximum entropy model is
                                                    employed to divide all the clusters into intact and damaged classes.
                                                    The tests on the LiDAR data at El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake rupture
                                                    prove the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method.</p>

                                                <p>The filtering of point clouds is a ubiquitous task in the processing
                                                    of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data; however, such filtering
                                                    processes are difficult because of the complex configuration of the
                                                    terrain features. The classical filtering algorithms rely on the
                                                    cautious tuning of parameters to handle various landforms. To
                                                    address the challenge posed by the bundling of different terrain
                                                    features into a single dataset and to surmount the sensitivity of
                                                    the parameters, in this study, we propose an adaptive surface filter
                                                    (ASF) for the classification of ALS point clouds. Based on the
                                                    principle that the threshold should vary in accordance to the
                                                    terrain smoothness, the ASF embeds bending energy, which
                                                    quantitatively depicts the local terrain structure to self-adapt the
                                                    filter threshold automatically. The ASF employs a step factor to
                                                    control the data pyramid scheme in which the processing window sizes
                                                    are reduced progressively, and the ASF gradually interpolates thin
                                                    plate spline surfaces toward the ground with regularization to
                                                    handle noise. Using the progressive densification strategy,
                                                    regularization and self-adaption, both performance improvement and
                                                    resilience to parameter tuning are achieved. When tested against the
                                                    benchmark datasets provided by ISPRS, the ASF performs the best in
                                                    comparison with all other filtering methods, yielding an average
                                                    total error of 2.85% when optimized and 3.67% when using the same

                                                <p>Lunar topographic information is essential for lunar scientific
                                                    investigations and exploration missions. Lunar orbiter imagery and
                                                    laser altimeter data are two major data sources for lunar
                                                    topographic modeling. Most previous studies have processed the
                                                    imagery and laser altimeter data separately for lunar topographic
                                                    modeling, and there are usually inconsistencies between the derived
                                                    lunar topographic models. This paper presents a novel combined block
                                                    adjustment approach to integrate multiple strips of the Chinese
                                                    Chang'E-2 imagery and NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)
                                                    Laser Altimeter (LOLA) data for precision lunar topographic
                                                    modeling. The participants of the combined block adjustment include
                                                    the orientation parameters of the Chang'E-2 images, the intra-strip
                                                    tie points derived from the Chang'E-2 stereo images of the same
                                                    orbit, the inter-strip tie points derived from the overlapping area
                                                    of two neighbor Chang'E-2 image strips, and the LOLA points. Two
                                                    constraints are incorporated into the combined block adjustment
                                                    including a local surface constraint and an orbit height constraint,
                                                    which are specifically designed to remedy the large inconsistencies
                                                    between the Chang'E-2 and LOLA data sets. The output of the combined
                                                    block adjustment is the improved orientation parameters of the
                                                    Chang'E-2 images and ground coordinates of the LOLA points, from
                                                    which precision lunar topographic models can be generated. The
                                                    performance of the developed approach was evaluated using the
                                                    Chang'E-2 imagery and LOLA data in the Sinus Iridum area and the
                                                    Apollo 15 landing area. The experimental results revealed that the
                                                    mean absolute image residuals between the Chang'E-2 image strips
                                                    were drastically reduced from tens of pixels before the adjustment
                                                    to sub-pixel level after adjustment. Digital elevation models (DEMs)
                                                    with 20 m resolution were generated using the Chang'E-2 imagery
                                                    after the combined block adjustment. Comparison of the Chang'E-2 DEM
                                                    with the LOLA DEM showed a good level of consistency. The developed
                                                    combined block adjustment approach is of significance for the full
                                                    comparative and synergistic use of lunar topographic data sets from
                                                    different sensors and different missions.</p>

                                                <p>Aiming at the problem of extracting 3D building facades and roofs
                                                    automatically, a 3D building extraction algorithm from pixel height
                                                    map, which is a product of oblique airborne imagery, is therefore
                                                    designed and implemented preliminarily. Compared with no or gradual
                                                    change on the ground or roofs, vertical facade planes show large
                                                    height gradients. So, this paper take advantage of the height
                                                    gradient feature to extract facades, at the same time use the
                                                    maximum entropy threshold feature to extract roof. Oblique images

                                                    The results show that it is an effective method to combine the

                                                <p>This paper presents a fl exible method for zoom lens calibration
                                                    and modeling using a planar checkerboard. The method
                                                    includes the following four steps. First, the principal point of
                                                    the zoom-lens camera is determined by a focus-of-expansion
                                                    approach. Second, the infl uences of focus changes on the
                                                    principal distance are modeled by a scale parameter. Third,
                                                    checkerboard images taken at varying object distances with
                                                    convergent image geometry are used for camera calibration.
                                                    Finally, the variations of the calibration parameters with
                                                    respect to the various zoom and focus settings are modeled
                                                    using polynomials. Three different types of lens are examined
                                                    in this study. Experimental analyses show that high precision
                                                    calibration results can be expected from the developed
                                                    approach. The relative measurement accuracy (accuracy normalized
                                                    with object distance) using the calibrated zoom-lens
                                                    camera model ranges from 1:5 000 to 1:25 000. The developed
                                                    method is of signifi cance to facilitate the use of zoom-lens
                                                    camera systems in various applications such as robotic exploration,
                                                    hazard monitoring, traffi c monitoring, and security
                                                    surveillance.</p>

                                                <h4>Abstract</h4>

                                                <p>Various lunar digital topographic models (DTMs) have been generated
                                                    from the data collected from earlier and recent lunar missions.
                                                    There are usually inconsistencies among them due to differences in
                                                    sensor configurations, data acquisition periods, and production
                                                    techniques. To obtain maximum value for science and exploration, the
                                                    multi-source lunar topographic datasets must be co-registered in a
                                                    common reference frame. Only such an effort will ensure the proper
                                                    calibration, registration, and analysis of the datasets, which in
                                                    turn will permit the full comparative and synergistic use of them.
                                                    This study presents a multi-feature-based surface matching method
                                                    for the co-registration of multiple lunar DTMs that incorporates
                                                    feature points, lines, and surface patches in surface matching to
                                                    guarantee robust surface correspondence. A combined adjustment model
                                                    is developed for the determination of seven transformation
                                                    parameters (one scale factor, three rotations, and three
                                                    translations), from which the multiple DTMs could be co-registered.
                                                    The lunar DTMs derived from the Chang’E-1, SELENE, and LRO laser
                                                    altimeter data in the Apollo 15 landing area and the Sinus Iridum
                                                    area are examined in this study. Small offsets were found among the
                                                    Chang’E-1, SELENE, and LRO DTMs. Through experimental analysis, the
                                                    developed multi-feature-based method was proven able to effectively
                                                    co-register multiple lunar DTMs. The performances of the
                                                    multi-feature-based surface matching method were compared with the
                                                    point-based method, and the former was proven to be superior to the
                                                    latter.</p>
