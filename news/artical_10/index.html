                    <p>In a recent article (Nature 516, S64–S65) about "NATURE INDEX: 2014 CHINA – Hong Kong" published by Nature on 18 December 2014, LSGI Scholar Dr. Bo Wu's research work about lunar mapping was highlighted as "Hong Kong Polytechnic University (Poly U) is the city's institution most focused on geosciences, which account for 9% of its WFC. In 2013, it published five articles in this field, including astrogeologist Bo Wu's landmark paper in Earth Planetary Science Letters on lunar topographic models".</p>
                    <p>The Nature Index is a global indicator of high-quality research. It tracks the affiliations of high-quality scientific articles published in a small group of highly selective journals that have been chosen by an independent group of working scientists. The weighted fractional count (WFC) of Nature Index is a weighted measure of author contributions to articles for an institution, a city, or a country.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Bo Wu has been working on lunar topographic mapping and analysis over the past several years. He developed innovative lunar mapping techniques and contributed to the Chinese Chang'E-3 lunar exploration mission by providing precision lunar topographic models for landing site selection. From 2013 to 2014, Dr. Bo Wu published three high-quality articles in Earth Planetary Science Letters, a prestigious international journal in geosciences and a core journal in the Nature Index database.</p>
