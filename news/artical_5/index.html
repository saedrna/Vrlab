                    <p><span class="pond10"><em><strong>Scope</strong></em></span></p>
                    <p>With increasing population and rapid urbanisation the management of populations and the environment has become complex. One aspect of this management has been the prediction, monitoring, prevention, and governing of man-made hazards and natural disasters. One tool that has indispensable in this respect has been GIS. </p>
                    <p>Across the world, the ability to bring together diverse sources of spatial data, and analyze and report on situations as they develop in the field has been critical in organising evacuations, guiding on the scene responders and allocating resources to victims. Unquestionably GIS is now an established tool in disaster management. </p>
                    <p>Urbanisation has also led to the emergence of evermore complex cities with high population densities. Much of the human activity in these cities happens indoors. For this reason in recent years there has a great interest in mapping indoor and enclosed environments in cities. One of the motivations of this mapping is the management of safety and security scenarios, such as fires, gas leaks, terrorism, and so forth. Safety and security scenarios are not limited to buildings in cities, but also include factories, underground tube stations, mines to name a few. </p>
                    <p>As part of the ISPRS Geospatial Week 2015, GiD4M is organising a workshop on the application of GIS in disaster management in urban areas. </p>
                    <p><strong><em>Conference Topics and Themes</em></strong></p>

                    <p><strong><em>Paper Submission and Publication</em></strong></p>
                    <p>  High-quality papers covering one or more of the above topics should be submitted electronically using the conference tool on the conference web site. Authors are invited to submit full papers for a double blind peer review process. The papers should be prepared according to the ISPRS guidelines for preparing manuscripts (http://www.isprs.org/documents/orangebook/app5.aspx) and should not exceed 8 pages in length. Accepted papers will appear as a Volume of the Annals of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and the Spatial Information Sciences. The deadline for the submission of full papers or abstracts is April 15, 2015. Notification of acceptance will occur by June 1, 2015. Provided acceptance by the referees, the camera-ready papers have to be submitted in PDF format by July 1, 2015.
