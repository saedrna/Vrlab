<h2>
<a NAME="I. Framework"></a>I. Framework</h2>
Senior research projects in Environmental Sciences have the following elements
in common:
<ol>
<li>
An environmental issue is identified.</li>

<li>
Other people's work on the topic is collected and evaluated.</li>

<li>
Data necessary to solving the problem are either collected by the student,
or obtained independently.</li>

<li>
Data are analyzed using techniques appropriate to the data set.</li>

<li>
Results of the analysis are reported and are interpreted in light of the
initial environmental issue.</li>
</ol>
The final outcome of this process is a senior thesis that you will complete
in the spring semester.&nbsp; The&nbsp; goal of the fall semester is that
you identify a research topic, find a research mentor, formulate a hypothesis,
understand the background of your project, develop or adapt appropriate
methods, and summarize the state of your project as a thesis proposal.
The goal is to progress as far as possible with the elements listed above
during the fall semester. The more you can accomplish during the fall,
the further you can drive the project in the end, and the more relaxed
the spring semester is going to be for you (and us).
<p>The purpose of writing a thesis proposal is to demonstrate&nbsp; that
<ol>
<li>
the thesis topic addresses a significant environmental problem;</li>

<li>
an organized plan is in place for collecting or obtaining data to help
solve the problem;</li>

<li>
methods of data analysis have been identified and are appropriate to the
data set.</li>
</ol>
If you can outline these points clearly&nbsp; in a proposal, then you will
be able to focus on a research topic and finish it rapidly.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A secondary purpose of the proposal is to train you in the art of proposal
writing.&nbsp; Any future career in Environmental Sciences, whether it
be in industry or academia will require these skills in some form.
<p>We are well aware that the best laid out research plans may go awry,
and that the best completed theses sometimes bear only little resemblance
to the thesis planned during the proposal. Therefore, when evaluating a
thesis proposal, we are not trying to assure ourselves that you have clearly
described a sure-fire research project with 0% risk of failure. (If there
was no risk of failure, it wouldn't be research.)
<p>Instead, what we're interested in seeing is if you have a clear handle
on the <i>process</i> and <i>structure</i> of research as it's practiced
by our discipline. If you can present a clear and reasonable thesis idea,
if you can clearly relate it to other relevant literature, if you can justify
its significance, if you can describe a method for investigating it, and
if you can decompose it into a sequence of steps that lead toward a reasonable
conclusion, then the thesis proposal is a success regardless of whether
you modify or even scrap the actual idea down the line and start off in
a different direction. What a successful thesis proposal demonstrates is
that, regardless of the eventual idea you pursue, you know the steps involved
in turning it into a thesis.
<h2>
<a NAME="II. Structure of a thesis proposal"></a>II. Structure of a thesis
proposal</h2>
Your thesis proposal should have the following elements in this order.
<ul>
<li>
Title page</li>

<li>
Abstract</li>

<li>
Table of contents</li>

<li>
Introduction</li>

<li>
Thesis statement</li>

<li>
Approach/methods</li>

<li>
Preliminary results and discussion</li>

<li>
Work plan including time table</li>

<li>
Implications of research</li>

<li>
List of references</li>
</ul>
The structure is very similar to that of a thesis or a scientific paper.
You will be able to use a large fraction of the material of the thesis
proposal in your final senior thesis. Of course, the state of the individual
projects at the end of the fall will vary, and therefore also the format
of the elements discussed below.
<p><b>Title page</b>
<ul>
<li>
contains short, descriptive title of the proposed thesis project&nbsp;
(should be fairly self-explanatory)</li>

<li>
and author, institution, department, resreach mentor, mentor's institution,
and date of delivery</li>
</ul>
<b>Abstract</b>
<ul>
<li>
the abstract is a brief summary of your thesis proposal</li>

<li>
its length should not exceed ~200 words</li>

<li>
present a brief introduction to the issue</li>

<li>
make the key statement of your thesis</li>

<li>
give a summary of how you want to address the issue</li>

<h2>
<a NAME="III. Order in which to write the proposal"></a>III. Order in which
to write the proposal</h2>
.&nbsp; Proceed in the following order:
<ol>
<li>
Make an outline of your thesis proposal&nbsp; before you start writing</li>

<li>
Prepare figures and tables</li>

<li>
Figure captions</li>

<li>
Methods</li>

<li>
Discussion of your data</li>

<li>
Inferences from your data</li>

<li>
Introduction</li>

<li>
Abstract</li>

<li>
Bibliography</li>
</ol>
This order may seem backwards. However, it is difficult to write an abstract
until you know your most important results.&nbsp; Sometimes, it is possible
to write the introduction first.&nbsp; Most often the introduction should
be written next to last.
<h2>
<a NAME="IV. Tips"></a>IV. Tips</h2>

<h3>
Figures</h3>

<ul>
<li>
"Pictures say more than a thousand words!" Figures serve to illustrate
important aspects&nbsp; of the background material, sample data, and analysis
techniques.</li>

<li>
A well chosen and well labeled figure can reduce text length, and improve
proposal clarity.&nbsp; Proposals often contain figures from other articles.&nbsp;
These can be appropriate, but you should consider modifying them if the
modifications will improve your point.</li>

<li>
The whole process of making a drawing is important for two reasons.&nbsp;
First, it clarifies your thinking.&nbsp; If you don’t understand the process,
you can’t draw it. Second, good drawings are very valuable.&nbsp; Other
scientists will understand your paper better if you can make a drawing
of your ideas.&nbsp; A co-author of mine has advised me: make figures that
other people will want to steal.&nbsp; They will cite your paper because
they want to use your figure in their paper.</li>

<li>
Make cartoons using a scientific drawing program.&nbsp; Depending upon
the subject of your paper, a cartoon might incorporate the following:</li>

<ul>
<li>
a picture of the scientific equipment that you are using and an explanation
of how it works;</li>

<li>
a drawing of a cycle showing steps, feedback loops, and bifurcations: this
can include chemical or mathematical equations;</li>

<li>
a flow chart showing the steps in a process and the possible causes and
consequences.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Incorporate graphs in the text or on separated sheets inserted in the thesis
proposal</li>

<li>
Modern computer technology such as scanners and drafting programs are available
in the department to help you create or modify pictures.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Grammar/spelling</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Poor grammar and spelling distract from the content of the proposal.&nbsp;
The reader focuses on the grammar and spelling problems and misses keys
points made in the text.&nbsp; Modern word processing programs have grammar
and spell checkers.&nbsp; Use them.</li>

<li>
Read your proposal aloud - then&nbsp; have a friend read it aloud. If your
sentences seem too long, make two or three sentences instead of one.&nbsp;
Try to write the same way that you speak when you are explaining a concept.
Most people speak more clearly than they write.</li>

<li>
You should have read your proposal over at least 5 times before handing
it in</li>

<li>
Simple wording is generally better</li>

<li>
If you get comments from others that seem completely irrelevant to you,
your paper is not written clearly enough never use a complex word if a
simpler word will do</li>
</ul>
