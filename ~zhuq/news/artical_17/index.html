                    <p><strong>FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS</strong><br>
                        The Urban Data Management Society has organised international symposia at various locations throughout Europe since 1971, and UDMS 2015 will visit Ghent, Belgium, for the first time. From its outset, UDMS has highlighted changes and trends in urban data and urban data management.  However, it is possible that the rate of emergence of new data and new technologies has never been as rapid as it is now. Trends including smart cities, smart phones, social media, 3D modelling, volunteered geographic information, building information modelling, augmented reality and augmented virtuality, social media and the Internet of Things all generate information about the urban environment and the people who live there. Additionally the volume of data generated in part through such techniques has in turn resulted in research into 'big data' – how best to handle the data, analyse it, visualise it in different contexts. Thus the challenges and opportunities facing those working with these New types of Urban Data are manifold. Given this, the general theme for UDMS 2015 is:</p>
                    <p><br>
                        <strong>New (urban) data and new tools for City Management</strong><br>
                        The organising committee invites you to submit a paper for presentation and to take part in this important event. Five types of submissions will be considered: <br>
                        Scientific papers up to 6000 words, for full paper peer review by three reviewers. These papers will be included in the UDMS Annual, to be published by Taylor and Francis<br>
                        Technical papers up to 4000 words presenting new solutions, review of potential new technologies and project results, for peer review. These papers will be included in the ISPRS Annals.<br>
                        Technical papers, especially from local authorities and professionals, presenting the description of experiences, solutions or problems requiring solutions, for abstract review, with a length of up to 4000 words. These papers will be included in the ISPRS Archives.<br>
                        Abstracts for the UDMS-website, 1500 words<br>
                        Short presentations, using no prepared written text, but only slides (20 slides, each slide 20 seconds, in total a 6.40' storytelling, providing a reflection about your own city project. This option may be especially relevant for for officials working in cities, and asks you to use the Pecha Kucha concept (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha). The short presentation can be given on the conference location in Ghent or by Skype.</p>
                    <p>All accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference. In addition, accepted papers will either be published in the ISPRS International Archives or Annals or included in the UDMS Annual 2015, which will be published by Taylor &amp; Francis as a hardbound book. <br>
                        Additionally, the UDMS National Representatives will select a number of papers, with attention to papers presented by young researchers or young professionals, for the UDMS 'Young Contributors' award. This will include those at the early stages of their research  career – e.g. PhD students – or early stage professionals, having less than 6 years' experience.<br>
                        We will also select the most original presentation using the "Pecha Kucha" story.</p>
                    <p>The International Programme Committee would like to receive proposals addressing, academic, technical and practitioner issues related to the symposium areas and topics of capturing, managing, analysing and visualising New Urban Data, in particular in relation to:</p>
