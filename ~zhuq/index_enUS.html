                                <p>Virtual Geographic Environments (VGEs) are proposed as a new generation of geographic analysis tool to contribute
                                    to human understanding of the geographic world and assist in solving geographic problems at a deeper level.
                                    The development of VGEs is focused on meeting the three scientific requirements of Geographic Information Science
                                    (GIScience) — multi-dimensional visualization, dynamic phenomenon simulation, and public participation.
                                    To provide a clearer image that improves user understanding of VGEs and to contribute to future scientific development,
                                    our research group is now focusing on some aspects of VGEs. </p>
                                <p>Generally, three major aspects are studied by our group: digital photogrammetry, multi-dimensional dynamic GIS and the Virtual Geographic Environments.</p>

                                                Aiming at the personalized navigation requirements of the tourists in complex scenic environments, an integrated navigation grid model is proposed to comprehensively represent the tourist preference and multidimensional dynamic environmental factors like the terrain, weather, tourist behaviors and related events. Based on this model, an A* algorithm of the dynamic routing for smart tourism is designed.
												The grid model of integrated multidimensional dynamic environmental information breaks through the limitation of the traditional tourist maps, which mainly depend on the static road network models, and supports the dynamic routing with an ability to perceive the real time environment and to adapt to tourist preference. To verify its effectiveness, the model was applied to the Dujiangyan scenic spot in a case study. The results show that the optimal route obtained by the proposed algorithm is 17.6% shorter than the recommended path in the integrated distance, and favors providing the dynamic, intelligent, precise and integrative location information service for tourists.</p>

                                                Semi-global matching (SGM) is essentially a discrete optimization for the disparity value of each pixel, under the assumption of disparity continuities. SGM overcomes the influence of the disparity discontinuities by a set of parameters. Using smaller parameters, the continuity constraint is weakened, which will cause significant noises in planar and textureless areas, reflected as the fluctuations on the final surface reconstruction. On the other hands, larger parameters will impose too much constraints on continuities, which may lead to losses of sharp features. To address this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive dense stereo matching methods for airborne images using with texture information. Firstly, the texture is quantified, and under the assumption that disparity variation is directly proportional to the texture information, the adaptive parameters are gauged accordingly. Second, SGM is adopted to optimize the discrete disparities using the adaptively tuned parameters. Experimental evaluations using the ISPRS benchmark dataset and images obtained by the SWDC-5 have revealed that the proposed method will significantly improve the visual qualities of the point clouds.</p>

                                                In order to avoid the disaster misjudgment and incorrect reports of landslide disaster, the detection and elimination of the gross errors of landslide monitoring data,
												has become a critical issue for the observational data quality control. The traditional data filtering methods using curve characteristics of single data source, 
												which are limited by the characteristic of mutations-smooth relations and it is also hard to effectively distinguish the gross error and singular value induced by external factors.
												To overcome these problems, an approach for gross errors detection and elimination guided by landslide knowledge is proposed in this paper. Experimental results prove that more accurate and reliable landslide deformation information can be available.

                                                 Focusing on the problems of inefficient 3D model scheduling and low visual consistency of complex 3D urban scene visualization, a self-adaptive organization and scheduling method for 3D urban scenes driven by visual perception is proposed.
												 Based on the spatial distribution of 3D city models, the adaptive quadtree partition was used to divide the complex 3D scene into different levels of granularity. Subsequently, traversing the quadtree from bottom to top, levels of detail (LODs) were generated for the intermediate nodes, and the geometric error of each layer was calculated to construct a flexible multi-granularity 3D tile model. 
												 Finally, visual perception parameters such as the shape, size, and height of the building model were evaluated by employing the screen error, which was used to constrain the self-adaptive scheduling of LODs. The 3D models of four LODs in Berlin were selected for an interactive 3D roaming test. 
												 The experimental results show that the rendering frame rate was more than 40 f/s based on the view-related hierarchical LOD dynamic scheduling, which could ensure efficient dynamic scheduling and visual consistency of the complex 3D urban scene in a network environment.</p>

                                                 Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) scheduling in emergency surveying and mapping (ESM) has complicated space and time constraints,
												 with diverse scheduling schemes. The existing scheduling methods are generally based on human experience, and not reliable. In order to realize the rapid response of post disaster ESM, 
												 a fast scheduling method for UAV resources is proposed.
												 The method comprehensively considers the constraints of the mission requirements, priorities, time windows, the geographical environment of the working area, and the ability of the UAV. 
												 A UAV scheduling model for ESM, is proposed that makes mission profit efficiency, mission completion rate,
												 and scheduling risk as optimization objectives. 
												 This solution is based on ant colony algorithm. 
												 Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the scheduling method.</p>

                                                 The visual analysis of spatio-temporal big data is not only the state-of-art research direction of both big data analysis and data visualization, but also the core module of pan-spatial information system. 
												 This paper reviews existing visual analysis methods at three levels:descriptive visual analysis, explanatory visual analysis and exploratory visual analysis, focusing on spatio-temporal big data's characteristics of multi-source, multi-granularity, multi-modal and complex association.
												 The technical difficulties and development tendencies of multi-modal feature selection, innovative human-computer interaction analysis and exploratory visual reasoning in the visual analysis of spatio-temporal big data were discussed. Research shows that the study of descriptive visual analysis for data visualizationis is relatively mature.The explanatory visual analysis has become the focus of the big data analysis, 
												 which is mainly based on interactive data mining in a visual environment to diagnose implicit reason of problem.
												 And the exploratory visual analysis method needs a major break-through.</p>

                                                 Because of the lack of relationships between matching line and adjacent lines in the process of individual line matching, and the weak reliability of the individual line descriptor facing on discontinue texture, 
												 this paper presents a reliable line matching algorithm for stereo images with topological relationship. 
												 The algorithm firstly generates grouped line pairs from lines extracted from the reference image and searching image according to the basic topological relationships such as distance and angle between the lines.
												 Then it takes the grouped line pairs as matching primitives,
												 and matches these grouped line pairs by using epipolar constraint, homography constraint, 
												 quadrant constraint and gray correlation constraint of irregular triangle in order.
												 And finally, it resolves the corresponding line pairs into two pairs of corresponding individual lines, and obtains one to one matching results after the post-processing of integrating, fitting, and checking. This paper adopts digital aerial images and close-range images with typical texture features to deal with the parameter analysis and line matching, and the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm in this paper can obtain reliable line matching results.</p>

                                                 Area coverage using imaging reconnaissance satellites belongs to mission planning problems constrained by spatio-temporal information. The current area coverage algorithms can be divided into two categories:based on single-satellite and multi-satellite. The former cannot fully utilize satellite resources, and is replaced by the latter gradually. However, the latter usually applies the existing intelligent optimization approaches simply. 
												 In addition, the drawback of both is heavily depending on user's intervene. Therefore, in this paper, 
												 a self-adaptive approach is proposed for the low-effective and time-consuming issue of current covering algorithms. 
												 Firstly, a self-adaptive way for grid division is presented to automatically generate grid; secondly, 
												 in order to balance imaging accuracy and efficiency, the largest visual coverage computing is proposed to determine the angle of each satellite; thirdly, a semantic-based sliding window optimizing strategy is designed to calculate planning sequence for area coverage. Compared with the classic algorithms, this method reduces human-computer interaction, and is more effective and robust. 
												 It has already been applied in area coverage of real conditions.</p>

                                                 The semantic classification of point clouds is a fundamental part of three-dimensional urban reconstruction. For datasets with high spatial resolution but significantly more noises, a general trend is to exploit more contexture information to surmount the decrease of discrimination of features for classification. However, previous works on adoption of contexture information are either too restrictive or only in a small region and in this paper, we propose a point cloud classification method based on multi-level semantic relationships, including point–homogeneity, supervoxel–adjacency and class–knowledge constraints, which is more versatile and incrementally propagate the classification cues from individual points to the object level and formulate them as a graphical model. The point–homogeneity constraint clusters points with similar geometric and radiometric properties into regular-shaped supervoxels that correspond to the vertices in the graphical model.
												 The supervoxel–adjacency constraint contributes to the pairwise interactions by providing explicit adjacent relationships between supervoxels. The class–knowledge constraint operates at the object level based on semantic rules, guaranteeing the classification correctness of supervoxel clusters at that level. International Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) benchmark tests have shown that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average per-area completeness and correctness of 93.88% and 95.78%, respectively. 
												 The evaluation of classification of photogrammetric point clouds and DSM generated from aerial imagery confirms the method’s reliability in several challenging urban scenes.</p>

                                                 Intelligent navigation and facility management in complex indoor environments are issues at the forefront of geospatial information science. 
												 Indoor spaces with fine geometric and semantic descriptions provide a solid foundation for various indoor applications,
												 but it is difficult to comprehensively extract free multi-floor indoor spaces from complex three-dimensional building models, such as those described using CityGML LoD4, with existing methods for the subdivision or extraction of indoor spaces based on vector topology processing. Therefore, this paper elaborates a new voxelbased approach for extracting free multi-floor indoor spaces from 3D building models. It transforms the complicated vector processing tasks into a simple raster process that consists of three steps: voxelization with semantic enhancement, voxel classification, and boundary extraction. Experiments illustrate that the proposed method can automatically and correctly extract free multi-floor indoor spaces, especially two typical kinds of open indoor spaces, namely,
												 lobbies and staircases.</p>

                                                 Indoor emergency response plays a critically important role in disaster management for cities, which must consider the evacuation of people in a dynamic indoor environment. The spatial model is the foundation for the specific analysis of indoor emergency responses, such as evacuations.
												 The current spatial model for evacuation has three primary pitfalls: (1) it primarily focuses on static spatial information, such as rooms, doors, and windows, and lacks dynamic information, such as events and sensors; 
												 (2) it mainly focuses on the horizontal space and the static scene and lacks a multi-story component that considers the different properties of stairs compared to planar areas; 
												 and (3) it places emphasis on the indoor navigation calculation with a 2D/3D network, which lacks individual properties that can support more complicated analysis, 
												 such as congestion and stagnation. In this paper, we propose a dynamic indoor field model with three typical characteristics. (1) It includes not only static information but also dynamic information, such as outdoor and indoor building geometry, sensors, fire spread, and personnel behavior.
												 (2) It supports multi-story buildings from the macro level (building level and floor level) to the micro level (room level and individual level) based on horizontal and vertical indoor space.
												 (3) It supports spatial calculations based on a three-dimensional space grid and can analyze potential congestion and stagnation during evacuation. We design a corresponding evacuation method that supports individual evacuation route finding and evacuation assessment. 
												 We perform a series of analyses of the applicability of the proposed model and the efficiency of the designed evacuation method based on multi-story evacuation studies. 
												 The simulation includes a total evacuation population exceeding 7000 individuals, and the analysis suggests that the new model and algorithm are effective in planning indoor emergency routes that avoid potential congestion or stagnation. </p>

                                                 The flood disaster management system (FDMS) is a platform developed to provide ongoing disaster reduction capabilities that cover the entire process of flood management.
												 The ontology-based approach links environmental models with disaster-related data to support FDMS-constructed workflows with suitable models and recommend appropriate datasets as model input automatically. This automated activity for model selection and data binding reduces the time-consuming and unreliable operations involved in traditional management techniques, 
												 which rely on manual retrieval through simple metadata indices—typically when flood management personnel are overwhelmed with large quantities of observed data. The OpenMI-based modular design used in the system unifies interfaces and data exchange to provide flexible and extensible architecture.
												 Subsequent 3D visualization improves the interpretability of disaster data and the effectiveness of decision-making processes. This paper presents an overview of the design and capabilities of FDMS that provides one-stop management for flood disasters.</p>

                                               Monitoring, response, mitigation and damage assessment of disasters places a wide variety of demands on the spatial and temporal resolutions of remote sensing images. Images are divided into tile pyramids by data sources or resolutions and published as independent image services for visualization.
											   A disaster-affected area is commonly covered by multiple image layers to express hierarchical surface information, which generates a large amount of namesake tiles from different layers that overlay the same location. The traditional tile retrieval method for visualization cannot distinguish between distinct layers and traverses all image datasets for each tile query. 
											   This process produces redundant queries and invalid access that can seriously affect the visualization performance of clients, servers and network transmission. This paper proposes an on-demand retrieval method for multi-layer images and defines semantic annotations to enrich the description of each dataset. By matching visualization demands with the semantic information of datasets, 
											   this method automatically filters inappropriate layers and finds the most suitable layer for the final tile query. The design and implementation are based on a two-layer NoSQL database architecture that provides scheduling optimization and concurrent processing capability.
											   The experimental results reflect the effectiveness and stability of the approach for multi-layer retrieval in disaster reduction visualization.</p>

                                                Constructing 3D railway scenes helps improve the railway information construction ability and the comprehensive railway management level. However, the existing modeling methods have disadvantages such as low flexibility in scene configuration,
												weak extensibility of scene objects and poor reusability of modeling knowledge.
												To enable multitype 3D railway scenes to be automatically constructed, a template-based knowledge reuse method was proposed in this paper. First, based on parsing of modeling operation characteristics and modeling knowledge expression, a modeling knowledge template was designed to store modeling knowledge and modeling operations in a parameterized way. The contents of this template were described in terms of semantic information, 
												geometric information, topologic information and reference system information, and the method for instantiating the modeling knowledge template was proposed. Second, a scene configuration template was designed to organize the instantiated modeling knowledge files and scene objects. By the use of a flexible tree structure, the scene configuration template enables extensibility of scene objects.
												Finally, the two types of templates were parsed in terms of scene organization, linear referencing information, geometric and topologic relationships, and semantic descriptions. In this way, different types of 3D railway scenes were generated automatically. After a prototype system was developed, experiments on automatic modeling of two 3D railway scenes were carried out to verify the template-based knowledge reuse method. 
												The experimental results show that the proposed method can be used to generate multitype 3D railway scenes automatically.
												With this method, model combination can be configured, model types can be extended and modeling knowledge can be reused.</p>

                                                 A novel method called knowledge-guided spatio-temporal consistent correlation analysis (KSTCCA) was developed to discover reliable deformation features induced by multiple factors based on multimode landslide monitoring data. 
												 Compared to conventional approaches, KSTCCA integrates both temporal and spatial correlation analysis to improve the consistency of deformation patterns and capture the spatio-temporal heterogeneities in multimode monitoring data.
												 KSTCCA considers both the landslide deformation mechanisms and the relationships between different influential factors as knowledge. Moreover, the method extracts the morphological structures of monitoring curves based on a seven-point approach and identifies knowledge rules using the k-means clustering method. Under the guidance of prior knowledge, a spatial correlation analysis is conducted based on support vector regression,
												 and a temporal correlation analysis of the time lag is carried out based on the morphological structure features.
												 Finally, three kinds of typical monitoring data, including deformation, rainfall, and reservoir water level data collected in the Baishuihe landslide area, China, are used for experimental analysis to verify the validity of the proposed method.</p>

                                                 Improving the matching reliability of multi-sensor imagery is one of the most challenging issues in recent years, particularly for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images.
												 It is difficult to deal with the noise influence, geometric distortions, and nonlinear radiometric difference between SAR and optical images. In this paper, a method for SAR and optical images matching is proposed.
												 First, interest points that are robust to speckle noise in SAR images are detected by improving the original phase-congruency-based detector. Second, feature descriptors are constructed for all interest points by combining a new Gaussian-Gamma-shaped bi-windows-based gradient operator and the histogram of oriented gradient pattern. 
												 Third, descriptor similarity and geometrical relationship are combined to constrain the matching processing. Finally, an approach based on global and local constraints is proposed to eliminate outliers. In the experiments, SAR images including COSMO-Skymed, RADARSAT-2, TerraSAR-X and HJ-1C images, 
												 and optical images including ZY-3 and Google Earth images are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. 
												 The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides significant improvements in the number of correct matches and matching precision compared with the state-of-the-art SIFT-like methods. 
												 Near 1 pixel registration accuracy is obtained based on the matching results of the proposed method.</p>

                                                    The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Geography Markup Language (GML) standard provides basic types and a framework for defining geo-informational data models such as CityGML and IndoorGML, which provide standard information models for 3D city modelling and lightweight indoor network navigation. Location information, which is the semantic engine that fuses big geo-information data, is however, discarded in these standards. The Chinese national standard of Indoor Multi-Dimensional Location GML (IndoorLocationGML) presented in this study can be used in ubiquitous indoor location intelligent applications for people and robots. IndoorLocationGML is intended as an indoor multi-dimensional location information model and exchange data format standard, mainly for indoor positioning and navigation. This paper introduces the standard’s main features: (1) terminology; (2) indoor location information model using a Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram; (3) indoor location information markup language based on GML; and (4) use cases. A typical application of the standard is then discussed. This standard is applicable to the expression, storage, and distribution of indoor multi-dimensional location information, and to the seamless integration of indoor–outdoor location information. The reference and basis are therefore relevant to publishers, managers, users, and developers of indoor navigation and location-based services (LBS). </p>

                                                The rapid and accurate assessment of building damage states using only post-event remote sensing data is critical when performing loss estimation in earthquake emergency response. Damaged roof detection is one of the most efficient methods of assessing building damage. In particular, airborne LiDAR is often used to detect roofs damaged by earthquakes, especially for certain damage types, due to its ability to rapidly acquire accurate 3D information on individual roofs. Earthquake-induced roof damages are categorized into surface damages and structural damages based on the geometry features of the debris and the roof structure. However, recent studies have mainly focused on surface damage; little research has been conducted on structural damage. This paper presents an original 3D shape descriptor of individual roofs for detecting roofs with surface damage and roofs exhibiting structural damage by identifying spatial patterns of compact and regular contours for intact roofs, as well as jagged and irregular contours for damaged roofs. The 3D shape descriptor is extracted from building contours derived from airborne LiDAR point clouds. First, contour clusters are extracted from contours that are generated from a dense DSM of individual buildings derived from point clouds. Second, the shape chaos indexes of contour clusters are computed as the information entropy through a contour shape similarity measurement between two contours in a contour cluster. Finally, the 3D shape descriptor is calculated as the weighted sum of the shape chaos index of each contour cluster corresponding to an individual roof. Damaged roofs are detected solely using the 3D shape descriptor with the maximum entropy threshold. Experiments using post-event airborne LiDAR point clouds of the 2010 Haiti earthquake suggest that the proposed damaged roof detection technique using the proposed 3D shape descriptor can detect both roofs exhibiting surface damage and roofs exhibiting structural damage with a high accuracy.</p>

                                                Least-squares matching is a standard procedure in photogrammetric applications for obtaining sub-pixel accuracies of image correspondences. However, least-squares matching has also been criticized for its instability, which is primarily reflected by the requests for the initial correspondence and favorable image quality. In image matching between oblique images, due to the blur, illumination differences and other effects, the image attributes of different views are notably different, which results in a more severe convergence problem. Aiming at improving the convergence rate and robustness of least-squares matching of oblique images, we incorporated prior geometric knowledge in the optimization process, which is reflected as the bounded constraints on the optimizing parameters that constrain the search for a solution to a reasonable region. Furthermore, to be resilient to outliers, we substituted the square loss with a robust loss function. To solve the composite problem, we reformulated the least-squares matching problem as a bound constrained optimization problem, which can be solved with bounds constrained Levenberg–Marquardt solver. Experimental results consisting of images from two different penta-view oblique camera systems confirmed that the proposed method shows guaranteed final convergences in various scenarios compared to the approximately 20–50% convergence rate of classical least-squares matching.</p>

                                                Combined bundle adjustment is a fundamental step in the processing of massive oblique images. Traditional bundle adjustment designed for nadir images gives identical weights to different parts of image point observations made from different directions, due to the assumption that the errors in the observations follow the same Gaussian distribution. However, because of their large tilt angles, aerial oblique images have trapezoidal footprints on the ground, and their areas correspond to conspicuously different ground sample distances. The errors in different observations no longer conform to the above assumption, which leads to suboptimal bundle adjustment accuracy and restricts subsequent 3D applications. To model the distribution of the errors correctly for the combined bundle adjustment of oblique images, this paper proposes an asymmetric re-weighting method. The scale of each pixel is used to determine a re-weighting factor, and each pixel is subsequently projected onto the ground to identify another anisotropic re-weighting factor using the shape of its quadrangle. Next, these two factors are integrated into the combined bundle adjustment using asymmetric weights for the image point observations; greater weights are assigned to observations with fine resolutions, and those with coarse resolutions are penalized. This paper analyzes urban and rural images captured by three different five-angle camera systems, from both proprietary datasets and the ISPRS/EuroSDR benchmark. The results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the traditional method in both back-projected and triangulated precision by approximately 5–10% in most cases. Furthermore, the misalignments of point clouds generated by the different cameras are significantly alleviated after combined bundle adjustment.</p>

                                                RGB-D sensors (sensors with RGB camera and Depth camera) are novel sensing systems that capture RGB images along with pixel-wise depth information. Although they are widely used in various applications, RGB-D sensors have significant drawbacks including limited measurement ranges (e.g., within 3 m) and errors in depth measurement increase with distance from the sensor with respect to 3D dense mapping. In this paper, we present a novel approach to geometrically integrate the depth scene and RGB scene to enlarge the measurement distance of RGB-D sensors and enrich the details of model generated from depth images. First, precise calibration for RGB-D Sensors is introduced. In addition to the calibration of internal and external parameters for both, IR camera and RGB camera, the relative pose between RGB camera and IR camera is also calibrated. Second, to ensure poses accuracy of RGB images, a refined false features matches rejection method is introduced by combining the depth information and initial camera poses between frames of the RGB-D sensor. Then, a global optimization model is used to improve the accuracy of the camera pose, decreasing the inconsistencies between the depth frames in advance. In order to eliminate the geometric inconsistencies between RGB scene and depth scene, the scale ambiguity problem encountered during the pose estimation with RGB image sequences can be resolved by integrating the depth and visual information and a robust rigid-transformation recovery method is developed to register RGB scene to depth scene. The benefit of the proposed joint optimization method is firstly evaluated with the publicly available benchmark datasets collected with Kinect. Then, the proposed method is examined by tests with two sets of datasets collected in both outside and inside environments. 
												The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed method.</p>

                                                Textureless and geometric discontinuities are major problems in state-of-the-art dense image matching methods, as they can cause visually significant noise and the loss of sharp features. Binary census transform is one of the best matching cost methods but in textureless areas, where the intensity values are similar, it suffers from small random noises. Global optimization for disparity computation is inherently sensitive to parameter tuning in complex urban scenes, and must compromise between smoothness and discontinuities. 
												The aim of this study is to provide a method to overcome these issues in dense image matching, by extending the industry proven Semi-Global Matching through 1) developing a ternary census transform, which takes three outputs in a single order comparison and encodes the results in two bits rather than one, and also 2) by using texture-information to self-tune the parameters, which both preserves sharp edges and enforces smoothness when necessary. Experimental results using various datasets from different platforms have shown that the visual qualities of the triangulated point clouds in urban areas can be largely improved by these proposed methods.</p>

                                                RGB-D sensors are novel sensing systems that capture RGB images along with pixel-wise depth information. Although they are widely used in various applications, RGB-D sensors have significant drawbacks with respect to 3D dense mapping of indoor environments.
												First, they only allow a measurement range with a limited distance (e.g., within 3 m) and a limited field of view. Second, the error of the depth measurement increases with increasing distance to the sensor. In this paper, we propose an enhanced RGB-D mapping method for detailed 3D modeling of large indoor environments by combining RGB image-based modeling and depth-based modeling. The scale ambiguity problem during the pose estimation with RGB image sequences can be resolved by integrating the information from the depth and visual information provided by the proposed system. A robust rigid-transformation recovery method is developed to register the RGB image-based and depth-based 3D models together. The proposed method is examined with two datasets collected in indoor environments for which the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed method </p>

                                                 Improving the matching reliability of low-altitude images is one of the most challenging issues in recent years, particularly for images with large viewpoint variation. In this study, an approach for low-altitude remote sensing image matching that is robust to the geometric transformation caused by viewpoint change is proposed. First, multiresolution local regions are extracted from the images and each local region is normalized to a circular area based on a transformation. 
												 Second, interest points are detected and clustered into local regions. 
												 The feature area of each interest point is determined under the constraint of the local region which the point belongs to. Then, a descriptor is computed for each interest point by using the classical scale invariant feature transform (SIFT). Finally, a feature matching strategy is proposed on the basis of feature similarity confidence to obtain reliable matches. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides significant improvements in the number of correct matches compared with other traditional methods.</p>

                                                    model, which remained information insufficient problem. Especially,
                                                    an intelligent navigation for different applications depends mainly
                                                    on the precise geometry and semantics of the navigation network. The
                                                    trouble caused by existed topology construction approaches can be
                                                    smoothed by employing IFC building model which contains detailed

                                                <p>Indoor navigation is increasingly widespread in complex indoor
                                                    environments, and indoor path planning is the most important part of
                                                    indoor navigation. Path planning generally refers to finding the
                                                    most suitable path connecting two locations, while avoiding
                                                    collision with obstacles. However, it is a fundamental problem,
                                                    especially for 3D complex building model. A common way to solve the
                                                    issue in some applications has been approached in a number of
                                                    relevant literature, which primarily operates on 2D drawings or
                                                    building layouts, possibly with few attached attributes for
                                                    obstacles. Although several digital building models in the format of
                                                    3D CAD have been used for path planning, they usually contain only
                                                    geometric information while losing abundant semantic information of
                                                    building components (e.g. types and attributes of building

                                                    of path planning by combining both geometric and semantic

                                                <h4>Abstract</h4>

                                                <p>With the rapid development of sensor networks and Earth observation
                                                    technology, a large quantity of disaster-related data is available,
                                                    such as remotely sensed data, historic data, case data, simulated
                                                    data, and disaster products. However, the efficiency of current data
                                                    management and service systems has become increasingly difficult due
                                                    to the task variety and heterogeneous data. For emergency
                                                    task-oriented applications, the data searches primarily rely on
                                                    artificial experience based on simple metadata indices, the high
                                                    time consumption and low accuracy of which cannot satisfy the speed
                                                    and veracity requirements for disaster products. In this paper, a
                                                    task-oriented correlation method is proposed for efficient disaster
                                                    data management and intelligent service with the objectives of 1)
                                                    putting forward disaster task ontology and data ontology to unify
                                                    the different semantics of multi-source information, 2) identifying
                                                    the semantic mapping from emergency tasks to multiple data sources
                                                    on the basis of uniform description in 1), and 3) linking
                                                    task-related data automatically and calculating the correlation
                                                    between each data set and a certain task. The method goes beyond
                                                    traditional static management of disaster data and establishes a
                                                    basis for intelligent retrieval and active dissemination of disaster
                                                    information. The case study presented in this paper illustrates the
                                                    use of the method on an example flood emergency relief task.

                                                <p>Public security incidents have been increasingly challenging to
                                                    address with their new features, including large-scale mobility,
                                                    multi-stage dynamic evolution, spatio-temporal concurrency and
                                                    uncertainty in the complex urban environment, which require
                                                    spatio-temporal association analysis among multiple regional video
                                                    data for global cognition. However, the existing video data
                                                    organizational methods that view video as a property of the spatial

                                                    relationship of scattered video shots captured from multiple video
                                                    channels, limit the query functions on interactive retrieval between
                                                    a camera and its video clips and hinder the comprehensive management
                                                    of event-related scattered video shots. GeoVideo, which maps video
                                                    frames onto a geographic space, is a new approach to represent the
                                                    geographic world, promote security monitoring in a spatial
                                                    perspective and provide a highly feasible solution to this problem.
                                                    This paper analyzes the large-scale personnel mobility in public
                                                    safety events and proposes a multi-level, event-related organization
                                                    method with massive GeoVideo data by spatio-temporal trajectory.
                                                    This paper designs a unified object identify(ID) structure to
                                                    implicitly store the spatio-temporal relationship of scattered video
                                                    clips and support the distributed storage management of massive

                                                <p>This paper proposes a reliable feature point matching method
                                                    for oblique images using various spatial relationships and
                                                    geometrical information for the problems resulted by the
                                                    large view point changes, the image deformations, blurring,
                                                    and other factors. Three spatial constraints are incorporated
                                                    to filter possible outliers, including a cyclic angular ordering
                                                    constraint, a local position constraint, and a neighborhood
                                                    conserving constraint. Other ancillary geometric information,
                                                    which includes the initial exterior orientation parameters
                                                    that are obtained from the platform parameters and a
                                                    rough DEM, are used to transform the oblique images geometrically
                                                    and reduce the perspective deformations. Experiment
                                                    results revealed that the proposed method is superior
                                                    to the standard SIFT regarding both precision and correct
                                                    matches using images obtained by the SWDC-5 system.

                                                <p>The filtering of point clouds is a ubiquitous task in the processing
                                                    of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data;
                                                    however, such filtering processes are difficult because of the
                                                    complex configuration of the terrain features.
                                                    The classical filtering algorithms rely on the cautious tuning of
                                                    parameters to handle various landforms.
                                                    To address the challenge posed by the bundling of different terrain
                                                    features into a single dataset
                                                    and to surmount the sensitivity of the parameters, in this study, we
                                                    propose an adaptive surface filter
                                                    (ASF) for the classification of ALS point clouds. Based on the
                                                    principle that the threshold should vary
                                                    in accordance to the terrain smoothness, the ASF embeds bending
                                                    energy, which quantitatively depicts
                                                    the local terrain structure to self-adapt the filter threshold
                                                    automatically. The ASF employs a step factor
                                                    to control the data pyramid scheme in which the processing window
                                                    sizes are reduced progressively, and
                                                    the ASF gradually interpolates thin plate spline surfaces toward the
                                                    ground with regularization to handle
                                                    noise. Using the progressive densification strategy, regularization
                                                    and self-adaption, both performance
                                                    improvement and resilience to parameter tuning are achieved. When
                                                    tested against the benchmark datasets
                                                    provided by ISPRS, the ASF performs the best in comparison with all
                                                    other filtering methods, yielding
                                                    an average total error of 2.85% when optimized and 3.67% when using
                                                    the same parameter set.

                                                    been used in many fields such as location-based services or location

                                                    method, named HBSTR-tree, which is a hybrid index structure
                                                    comprising spatio-temporal
                                                    R-tree, B*-tree and Hash table. To improve the index generation
                                                    efficiency, rather than
                                                    directly inserting trajectory points, we group consecutive
                                                    trajectory points as nodes according
                                                    to their spatio-temporal semantics and then insert them into
                                                    spatio-temporal R-tree as leaf
                                                    nodes. Hash table is used to manage the latest leaf nodes to reduce
                                                    the frequency of
                                                    insertion. A new spatio-temporal interval criterion and a new
                                                    node-choosing sub-algorithm
                                                    are also proposed to optimize spatio-temporal R-tree structures. In
                                                    addition, a B*-tree
                                                    sub-index of leaf nodes is built to query the trajectories of
                                                    targeted objects efficiently.
                                                    Furthermore, a database storage scheme based on a NoSQL-type DBMS is
                                                    also proposed
                                                    for the purpose of cloud storage. Experimental results prove that
                                                    HBSTR-tree outperforms
                                                    TB*-tree in some aspects such as generation efficiency, query
                                                    performance and query type.

                                                <p>Our study proposes a new local model to accurately control an avatar
                                                    using six inertial sensors in real-time. Creating such a system to
                                                    assist interactive control of a full-body avatar is challenging
                                                    because control signals from our performance interfaces are usually
                                                    inadequate to completely determine the whole body movement of human
                                                    actors. We use a pre-captured motion database to construct a group
                                                    of local regression models, which are used along with the control
                                                    signals to synthesize whole body human movement. By synthesizing a
                                                    variety of human movements based on actors’ control in real-time,
                                                    this study verifies the effectiveness of the proposed system.
                                                    Compared with the previous models, our proposed model can synthesize
                                                    more accurate results. Our system is suitable for common use because
                                                    it is much cheaper than commercial motion capture systems.</p>

                                                <h4>Abstract</h4>

                                                <p>Abstract Virtual Geographic Environments (VGEs) are proposed as a new
                                                    generation of geographic analysis tool to contribute to human
                                                    understanding of the geographic world and assist in solving
                                                    geographic problems at a deeper level. The development of VGEs is
                                                    focused on meeting the three scientific requirements of Geographic
                                                    Information Science (GIScience) — multi-dimensional visualization,
                                                    dynamic phenomenon simulation, and public participation. To provide
                                                    a clearer image that improves user understanding of VGEs and to
                                                    contribute to future scientific development, this article reviews
                                                    several aspects of VGEs. First, the evolutionary process from maps
                                                    to previous GISystems and then to VGEs is illustrated, with a
                                                    particular focus on the reasons VGEs were created. Then, extended
                                                    from the conceptual framework and the components of a complete VGE,
                                                    three use cases are identified that together encompass the current
                                                    state of VGEs at different application levels: 1) a tool for
                                                    geo-object-based multi-dimensional spatial analysis and
                                                    multi-channel interaction, 2) a platform for geo-process-based
                                                    simulation of dynamic geographic phenomena, and 3) a workspace for
                                                    multi-participant-based collaborative geographic experiments. Based
                                                    on the above analysis, the differences between VGEs and other
                                                    similar platforms are discussed to draw their clear boundaries.
                                                    Finally, a short summary of the limitations of current VGEs is
                                                    given, and future directions are proposed to facilitate ongoing
                                                    progress toward forming a comprehensive version of VGEs.</p>

                                                <p>The Chinese Government and citizens face enormous challenges of
                                                    disaster management as widespread devastation, economic damages, and
                                                    loss of human lives caused by increasing natural disasters. Disaster
                                                    management requires a complicated iterative process that includes
                                                    disaster monitoring, early detection, forecasting, loss assessment,
                                                    and efficient analysis of disaster reduction. Each task typically
                                                    involves the use of technologists and multiple geospatial
                                                    information resources, including sensors, data sources, models,
                                                    geo-tools, software packages, and computing resources. However, most
                                                    existing disaster management systems operate in a typical passive
                                                    data-centric mode, where resources cannot be fully utilized. This
                                                    impediment is partially being addressed by the increasingly complex
                                                    application requirements and the growing availability of diverse
                                                    resources. In this paper, we summarize and analyze the practical
                                                    problems experienced by the National Disaster Reduction Application
                                                    System of China. To address the issues of data-centric, centralized,
                                                    isolated solutions, we propose a novel Focusing Service Mechanism,
                                                    which is capable of scheduling and allocating for optimum
                                                    utilization of multiple resources, to dynamically generate
                                                    collaborative and on-demand disaster information services. We also
                                                    demonstrate the design and implementation of the Integrated Disaster
                                                    Information Service System (IDISS). Through the service strategies
                                                    of Virtualizing, Wrapping, and Integrating, disaster-related
                                                    resources are constructed into services in the IDISS. These services
                                                    are dynamically aggregated into focusing service chains, for diverse
                                                    disaster management tasks. Actual applications illustrate that the
                                                    proposed service system can significantly improve the capability of
                                                    disaster management in China.

                                                <p>A complex 3D city model contains detailed descriptions of both its
                                                    appearance and its internal structure, including architectural
                                                    components. Because of the topological complexity and the large
                                                    volumes of data in such models, profiling is an effective method to
                                                    present the internal structure, the distributed characteristics, and
                                                    the hierarchical relationships of the model to provide intuitive
                                                    visual information to the viewer and to reveal the relationships
                                                    between the elements of the model and the whole. However, with
                                                    commonly used boundary descriptions, it is difficult to
                                                    comprehensively preserve the consistency of three-dimensional
                                                    profiling using existing algorithms based on geometric constraints.
                                                    This paper proposes a novel semantics-constrained profiling approach
                                                    to ensure the consistency of the geometrical, topological, and
                                                    semantic relationships when profiling complex 3D city models. The
                                                    approach transforms the 3D model’s boundary description, defined
                                                    using the CityGML standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC),
                                                    into a set of unified volumetric features described as solids. This
                                                    approach is characterized by (1) the use of the concepts of semantic
                                                    relationships, virtual edges, and virtual surfaces; (2) the semantic
                                                    analysis of 3D models and the extraction of volumetric features as
                                                    basic geometric analytic units; (3) the completion of structural
                                                    connectivity and space coverage for each volumetric feature, which
                                                    is represented as a solid model; and (4) the use of a reliable 3D
                                                    Boolean operation for efficient and accurate profiling. A typical
                                                    detailed 3D museum model is used as an example to illustrate the
                                                    profiling principle, and the experimental results demonstrate the
                                                    correctness and effectiveness of this approach.</p>

                                                <p>This paper presents a flexible method for zoom lens calibration
                                                    and modeling using a planar checkerboard. The method
                                                    includes the following four steps. First, the principal point of
                                                    the zoom-lens camera is determined by a focus-of-expansion
                                                    approach. Second, the infl uences of focus changes on the
                                                    principal distance are modeled by a scale parameter. Third,
                                                    checkerboard images taken at varying object distances with
                                                    convergent image geometry are used for camera calibration.
                                                    Finally, the variations of the calibration parameters with
                                                    respect to the various zoom and focus settings are modeled
                                                    using polynomials. Three different types of lens are examined
                                                    in this study. Experimental analyses show that high precision
                                                    calibration results can be expected from the developed
                                                    approach. The relative measurement accuracy (accuracy normalized
                                                    with object distance) using the calibrated zoom-lens
                                                    camera model ranges from 1:5 000 to 1:25 000. The developed
                                                    method is of significance to facilitate the use of zoom-lens
                                                    camera systems in various applications such as robotic exploration,
                                                    hazard monitoring, traffic monitoring, and security
                                                    surveillance.</p>

                                                    natural, free and fast interface for multi-user interaction.
                                                    However, the typical multi-user interaction method applied in 3D CAD
                                                    systems is strict consistency maintenance, such as locking mechanism
                                                    and floor control, which may generate a stagnant and unnatural

                                                    Based on the multi-tier distributed 3D GIS framework, this paper
                                                    presents a multi-level cache approach for dynamic data loading. It
                                                    aims to establish in 3D GIS spatial database engine (3DGIS-SDE) the
                                                    unified management mechanism of caches on three levels, including:
                                                    the client memory cache (CMC) oriented to sharing application, the
                                                    client file cache (CFC) organized by index, as well as the
                                                    application server memory cache (ASMC) of structural consistency.
                                                    With the help of the proposed optimized cache replacement policy,
                                                    multi-level cache consistency maintenance as well as multithread
                                                    loading model designed in the paper, the engine is able to
                                                    adaptively make full use of each-level caches according to their own
                                                    application properties and achieve effective coordination between
                                                    them. Finally, a practical 3D GIS database based on Oracle 11g is
                                                    employed for test. The experimental results prove this approach
                                                    could satisfy multi-user concurrent applications of 3D visual

                                                <p>A complex 3D building model contains a detailed description of both
                                                    its appearance and internal structure with authentic architectural
                                                    components. Because of its high complexity and huge data volumes,
                                                    using a less detailed representation for the distant visual
                                                    application of such a model is preferable. However, most mesh
                                                    simplification algorithms cannot preserve manmade features of such
                                                    models, and the existing 3D generalization algorithms are mainly
                                                    proposed for regular-shaped buildings. More importantly, neither
                                                    method can consistently express geometry, topological relations, and
                                                    semantics in multiple discrete Levels of Details (LoDs). This paper
                                                    presents a novel mathematical morphology-based algorithm that
                                                    generalizes the complex 3D building model in a unified manner using
                                                    the following steps: (1) semantic relationships between components,
                                                    which reflect structural connectivity in the building at a certain
                                                    LoD, are defined and extracted; (2) semantically connected
                                                    components are merged and trivial geometric features of the
                                                    components are eliminated simultaneously, with semantics associated
                                                    with components then updated according to the merging; and (3)
                                                    post-process is carried out to further reduce the redundancy of
                                                    facets. The semantic relationships extracted ensure the proper
                                                    generalization of topological relations and semantics of building
                                                    components, and mathematical morphological operations implemented in
                                                    the algorithm are capable of handling closed two-manifold components
                                                    of various shapes. Experiments on both complex 3D building models in

                                                <p>Typical characteristics of remote sensing applications are concurrent
                                                    tasks, such as those found in disaster rapid response. The existing
                                                    composition approach to geographical information processing service
                                                    chain, searches for an optimisation solution and is what can be
                                                    deemed a “selfish” way. This way leads to problems of conflict
                                                    amongst concurrent tasks and decreases the performance of all
                                                    service chains. In this study, a non-cooperative game-based
                                                    mathematical model to analyse the competitive relationships between
                                                    tasks, is proposed. A best response function is used, to assure each
                                                    task maintains utility optimisation by considering composition
                                                    strategies of other tasks and quantifying conflicts between tasks.
                                                    Based on this, an iterative algorithm that converges to Nash
                                                    equilibrium is presented, the aim being to provide good convergence
                                                    and maximise the utilisation of all tasks under concurrent task
                                                    conditions. Theoretical analyses and experiments showed that the
                                                    newly proposed method, when compared to existing service composition
                                                    methods, has better practical utility in all tasks.</p>

                                                <p> Vehicle-borne laser-scanned point clouds have become increasingly
                                                    important 3D data sources in fields such as digital city modeling
                                                    and emergency response management. Aiming at reducing the technical
                                                    bottlenecks of management and visualization of very large point
                                                    cloud data sets, this paper proposes a new spatial organization
                                                    method called 3DOR-Tree, which integrates Octree and 3D R-Tree data
                                                    structures. This method utilizes Octree index rapid convergence to
                                                    generate R-Tree leaf nodes, which are inserted directly into the
                                                    R-Tree, thus avoiding time-consuming point-by-point insertion
                                                    operations. Furthermore, this paper extends the R-Tree structure to
                                                    support LOD (level of detail) models. Based on the extended
                                                    structure, a practical data management method is presented. Finally,
                                                    an adaptive control method for LODS of point clouds is illustrated.
                                                    Typical experimental results show that our method possesses
                                                    quasi-real-time index construction speed, a good storage utilization
                                                    rate, and efficient visualization performance.</p>

                                                <p> This paper presents a triangulation-based hierarchical image
                                                    matching method for wide-baseline images. The method includes the
                                                    following three steps: (a) image orientation by incorporating the
                                                    SIFT algorithm with the RANSAC approach, (b) feature matching based
                                                    on the self-adaptive triangle constraint, which includes
                                                    point-to-point matching and subsequent point-to-area matching, and
                                                    (c) triangulation constrained dense matching based on the previous
                                                    matched results. Two new constraints, the triangulation-based
                                                    disparity constraint and triangulation-based gradient orientation
                                                    constraint, are developed to alleviate the matching ambiguity for
                                                    wide-baseline images. A triangulation based affine-adaptive
                                                    cross-correlation is developed to help find correct matches even in
                                                    the image regions with large perspective distortions. Experiments
                                                    using Mars ground wide-baseline images and terrestrial wide-baseline
                                                    images revealed that the proposed method is capable of generating
                                                    reliable and dense matching results for terrain mapping and surface
                                                    reconstruction from the wide-baseline images.</p>

                                                    constraint and other constraints. The newly matched points and edges
                                                    are inserted into the triangulations and the constrained
                                                    triangulations are updated dynamically along with the matching
                                                    propagation. The final results will be the final edge-constrained
                                                    triangulations generated from the successfully matched points and
                                                    edges. Experiments using typical space-borne, airborne, and
                                                    terrestrial images with poor textures revealed that the integrated
                                                    point and edge matching method based on self-adaptive triangulations
                                                    is able to produce dense and reliable matching results. Moreover,
                                                    from the final matched points and edges, 3D points and edges
                                                    preserving the physical boundaries of objects can be further derived
                                                    based on photogrammetric techniques, which is ideal for further
                                                    object modeling applications.</p>

                                                <p>Reliable image matching is an essential and difficult task in digital
                                                    photogrammetry and computer vision. Possible problems from geometric
                                                    distortions, illumination changes, scale changes and difficult
                                                    texture conditions will result in matching ambiguity, especially for
                                                    close-range image matching. This paper presents a multiple
                                                    close-range image matching method for surface reconstruction based
                                                    on a self-adaptive triangle constraint. This method features two
                                                    aspects. First, the triangles constructed from the previously
                                                    matched interest points provide strong geometric constraints for the
                                                    subsequent point matching combined with gradient orientation and
                                                    disparity constraints. The dynamic update of the triangulation
                                                    adapts automatically to the changes of image textures. Secondly, a
                                                    consistency check in object space is performed to remove possible
                                                    mismatches. Using three sets of actual triple overlapped close-range
                                                    images for the experiment, the results revealed that the proposed
                                                    method provides improved matching reliability.</p>

                                                <p>The paper presents an automatic method for the reconstruction of
                                                    building models from video image sequences. These videos may be
                                                    recorded using a hand-held camera or a camera mounted on a moving
                                                    car. Such terrestrial video sequences are economic and flexible.
                                                    Presenting buildings as geometric models–rather than for instance a
                                                    representation from a simple meshing of 3D points–enables one to
                                                    perform a wide range of analyses. However, sparse 3D points and 3D
                                                    edges do not contain topological relations. Therefore, integrating
                                                    building structure knowledge into the reconstruction steps plays an
                                                    important role in our method. First, some rules are applied to
                                                    reasonably group the extracted features. Then, a suitable outline
                                                    and normal direction are specified for each surface patch. Based on
                                                    these surface patches, a hybrid model- and data-driven method is
                                                    used to recover a building model from both the extracted surface
                                                    patches and hypothesized parts. Using the building structure
                                                    knowledge leads to a simple and fast reconstruction method, and also
                                                    enables one to obtain the main structures of buildings. The results
                                                    show that this method correctly sets up topological relationships
                                                    between generated surface patches and also obtains reasonable
                                                    structure models in occluded areas. Therefore, the reconstructed
                                                    models satisfy requirements for both visualization and analysis.</p>

                                                <p>Aiming at the fundamental issue of optimal design of discrete levels
                                                    of detail (LOD) for the visualization of complicated 3D building
                                                    façades, this paper presents a new quantitative analytical method of
                                                    perceptible 3D details based on perceptual metric. First, the
                                                    perceptual metric is defined as the quantitative indicator of the
                                                    visual perceptibility of façade details at a given viewing distance.
                                                    Then, according to the human vision system, an algorithm employing
                                                    2D discrete wavelet transform and contrast sensitivity function is
                                                    developed to extract the value of perceptual metric from the
                                                    rendered image of the façade. Finally, a perceptual metric function
                                                    is defined, based on the perceptual metric values extracted at equal
                                                    interval viewing distances. The minimum detail redundancy model is
                                                    then proposed for the optimal design of discrete LODs. This method
                                                    provides a quantitative instruction for generating discrete LODs.
                                                    The experimental results prove the effectiveness and great potential
                                                    of this method.</p>

                                                <p>The extraction of object features from massive unstructured point
                                                    clouds with different local densities, especially in the presence of
                                                    random noisy points, is not a trivial task even if that feature is a
                                                    planar surface. Segmentation is the most important step in the
                                                    feature extraction process. In practice, most segmentation
                                                    approaches use geometrical information to segment the 3D point
                                                    cloud. The features generally include the position of each point (X,
                                                    Y and Z), locally estimated surface normals and residuals of best
                                                    fitting surfaces; however, these features could be affected by noisy
                                                    points and in consequence directly affect the segmentation results.
                                                    Therefore, massive unstructured and noisy point clouds also lead to
                                                    bad segmentation (over-segmentation, under-segmentation or no
                                                    segmentation). While the RANSAC (random sample consensus) algorithm
                                                    is effective in the presence of noise and outliers, it has two
                                                    significant disadvantages, namely, its efficiency and the fact that
                                                    the plane detected by RANSAC may not necessarily belong to the same
                                                    object surface; that is, spurious surfaces may appear, especially in
                                                    the case of parallel-gradual planar surfaces such as stairs. The
                                                    innovative idea proposed in this paper is a modification for the
                                                    RANSAC algorithm called Seq-NV-RANSAC. This algorithm checks the
                                                    normal vector (NV) between the existing point clouds and the
                                                    hypothesised RANSAC plane, which is created by three random points,
                                                    under an intuitive threshold value. After extracting the first
                                                    plane, this process is repeated sequentially (Seq) and
                                                    automatically, until no planar surfaces can be extracted from the
                                                    remaining points under the existing threshold value. This prevents
                                                    the extraction of spurious surfaces, brings an improvement in
                                                    quality to the computed attributes and increases the degree of
                                                    automation of surface extraction. Thus the best fit is achieved for
                                                    the real existing surfaces</p>

                                                <p>Depth contours on a chart are important for safe navigation. The
                                                    ambiguity problem can appear when points of equal depth are joined
                                                    in contouring. Unreasonable solutions may mistake a shallow area for
                                                    a deep one, which could result in a potential danger for navigation.
                                                    A solution is presented to solve the ambiguity problem using
                                                    constrained lines formed by two shallow depths. The constrained
                                                    lines are used to limit the joining of the points with equal depth.
                                                    Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can
                                                    reduce the dangers of producing non-existent deep areas in
                                                    bathymetric contouring.</p>

                                                <p>The efficient display of flooding in intertidal zones is crucial to
                                                    coastal applications (e.g., coastal zone management and anti-flood
                                                    directing systems). This paper proposes a new algorithm to plot
                                                    flooded intertidal areas. Initially, a digital tide-coordinated
                                                    shoreline (DTS) is traced on the basis of creating a digital
                                                    intertidal zone model (DIZM) and an instantaneous water surface
                                                    model (IWSM). Then unconnected depressions are obtained depending on
                                                    the type of DTS. At the same time, the algorithm detects unconnected
                                                    depressions by considering the influences of the changing water
                                                    level, and creates an index from different water levels to
                                                    corresponding depressions. Finally, unconnected depressions are
                                                    effectively handled and flooded areas are plotted correctly.
                                                    Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm results
                                                    in a more accurate and efficient display than with traditional
                                                    algorithms.</p>

                                                <p>The existing road‐network models based on the 2D link‐node of roadway
                                                    centrelines have inhibited lane‐oriented network flow analysis and
                                                    multi‐dimensional inventory management in complicated 3D urban
                                                    environments. This paper proposes a hierarchical lane‐oriented 3D
                                                    road‐network model (HL‐3DRNM), with a unified modelling language
                                                    (UML) diagram. HL‐3DRNM is a non‐planar topological model with the
                                                    support of a 3D lane ribbon cartographic display, which is
                                                    characterized by: (1) multiple topological and cartographic
                                                    representations and various abstraction levels (street, road
                                                    segment, carriageway and lane); and (2) referenced multi‐dimensional
                                                    road information (point, line, area and volume) at lane level.
                                                    HL‐3DRNM provides solid mathematical foundations for a more detailed

                                                    navigation in the increasingly complicated 3D urban transportation

                                                <p>The sub-pixel location of interest points is one of the most
                                                    important tasks in refined image-based 3D reconstruction in digital
                                                    photogrammetry. The interest point detectors based on the Harris
                                                    principles are generally used for stereoscopic image matching and
                                                    subsequent 3D reconstruction. However, the locations of the interest
                                                    points detected in this way can only be obtained to 1 pixel
                                                    accuracy. The Harris detector has the following characteristics: (1)
                                                    the Harris interest strength, which denotes the distinctiveness of
                                                    an interest point, is a grey scale descriptor which computes the
                                                    gradient at each sample point in a region around the point, and (2)
                                                    the Harris interest strengths of the pixels in a template window
                                                    centred on the interest point exhibit an approximately paraboloid
                                                    distribution. This paper proposes a precise location method to
                                                    improve the precision of the interest points on the basis of these
                                                    characteristics of the Harris interest strength. Firstly, a least
                                                    squares fit of a paraboloid function to the image grey scale surface
                                                    using the Harris interest strength is designed in a template window
                                                    and a Gaussian-distance algorithm is employed to determine the
                                                    weight. Then, the precise coordinates of this interest point are
                                                    obtained by calculating the extremities of the fitting surface. The
                                                    location accuracy of this method is studied both from the
                                                    theoretical and the practical point of view. Experimental analysis
                                                    is illustrated with synthetic images as well as actual images, which
                                                    yielded a location accuracy of 0·15 pixels. Furthermore,
                                                    experimental results also indicate that this method has the desired
                                                    anti-image-noise and efficiency characteristics.</p>

                                                    strategies: the stochastic propagation, the adjacent propagation
                                                    based on the topological relationship of triangles, and the
                                                    self-adaptive propagation, which considers the texture features are
                                                    proposed. The detailed algorithms of these three propagation
                                                    strategies are also presented. To compare these strategies, a stereo
                                                    pair with typic texture features is employed to describe the
                                                    different propagation manners of these three strategies, and an
                                                    experimental analysis is illustrated with different aerial stereo
                                                    pairs. From test results, the following has been found: (1)
                                                    stochastic propagation gives the worst matching results; (2)
                                                    self-adaptive propagation performs better than the adjacent
                                                    propagation by making use of the global “best first” strategy. From
                                                    these conclusions, the self-adaptive propagation strategy is
                                                    recommended for reliable stereo image matching under the dynamic
                                                    triangle constraint.</p>

                                                <p>A three-dimensional (3D) spatial index is required for real time
                                                    applications of integrated organization and management in virtual
                                                    geographic environments of above ground, underground, indoor and
                                                    outdoor objects. Being one of the most promising methods, the R-tree
                                                    spatial index has been paid increasing attention in 3D geospatial
                                                    database management. Since the existing R-tree methods are usually
                                                    limited by their weakness of low efficiency, due to the critical
                                                    overlap of sibling nodes and the uneven size of nodes, this paper
                                                    introduces the k-means clustering method and employs the 3D overlap
                                                    volume, 3D coverage volume and the minimum bounding box shape value
                                                    of nodes as the integrative grouping criteria. A new spatial cluster
                                                    grouping algorithm and R-tree insertion algorithm is then proposed.
                                                    Experimental analysis on comparative performance of spatial indexing
                                                    shows that by the new method the overlap of R-tree sibling nodes is
                                                    minimized drastically and a balance in the volumes of the nodes is
                                                    maintained.</p>

                                                <p>This paper compares several stereo image interest point detectors
                                                    with respect to their repeatability and information content through
                                                    experimental analysis. The Harris-Laplace detector gives better
                                                    results than other detectors in areas of good texture; however, in
                                                    areas of poor texture, the Harris-Laplace detector may be not the
                                                    best choice. A featurerelated filtering strategy is designed for the
                                                    Harris-Laplace detector (as well as the standard Harris detector) to
                                                    improve the repeatability and information content for imagery with
                                                    both good and poor texture: (a) the local information entropy is
                                                    computed to describe the local feature of the image; and (b) the
                                                    redundant interest points are filtered according to the interest
                                                    strength and the local information entropy. After the filtering
                                                    process, the repeatability and information content of the final
                                                    interest points are improved, and the mismatching then can be
                                                    reduced. This conclusion is supported by experimental analysis with
                                                    actual stereo images.</p>

                                                <p>Depression filling and direction assignment over flat areas are
                                                    critical issues in hydrologic analysis. This paper proposes an
                                                    efficient approach for the treatment of depressions and flat areas,
                                                    based on gridded digital elevation models. Being different from the
                                                    traditional raster neighborhood process which is time consuming, a
                                                    hybrid method of vector and raster manipulation is designed for
                                                    depression filling, followed by a neighbor-grouping scan method to
                                                    assign the flow direction over flat areas. The results from
                                                    intensive experiments show that there is a linear relationship
                                                    between time efficiency and data volume, and the extracted
                                                    hydrologic structures of flat areas are also more reasonable than
                                                    those proposed by the existing methods.</p>

                                                    image-matching propagation, this letter analyzes the affects of
                                                    different numbers and different distributions of seed points on the
                                                    image-matching results. The concept of distribution quality is
                                                    introduced to quantify the distribution of seed points. An intensive

                                                    aerial images and, based on the experimental results, a seed point

                                                    propagation is proposed. An automatic selection method is then
                                                    introduced that gives good distribution quality for a defined number

                                                <p>This study demonstrates the utilization of the well-defined points to
                                                    improve the reliability and accuracy of image matching. The basic
                                                    principle is: (a) to triangulate a few well-defined points within
                                                    the stereo model area to form a coarse triangulation; (b) to detect
                                                    certain amount of corners within each triangle for further matching;
                                                    (c) to propagate the matching of corner points from the reference
                                                    points (i.e., the three triangle vertices) to obtain the best
                                                    matching for each of these corners; (d) to dynamically update the
                                                    triangulation by inserting the newly matched corner; and (e) to
                                                    further detect corners and perform matching for them until a
                                                    pre-defined criteria (the minimum size of triangle or the largest
                                                    number of points matched) is reached. Experimental results reveal:
                                                    (a) the false matching caused by the occlusion and repetitive
                                                    texture is diminished; (b) the accuracy is improved, i.e., with a
                                                    reduction of RMSE of check points (located in different types of
                                                    terrain areas) by 12 percent to 62 percent, and a reduction of the
                                                    largest error by up to two times; and (c) most building corners and
                                                    boundary points of main objects could be matched directly and

                                                <p>This paper examines the differences between CyberCity,
                                                    three-dimensional (3D) geographic information systems (GIS) and
                                                    CyberCity GIS (CCGIS). A CyberCity is defined as a virtual
                                                    representation of a city that enables a user to explore and interact
                                                    in cyberspace with the vast amount of environmental and cultural
                                                    information gathered about the city. The technical characteristics
                                                    of a CyberCity GIS prototype software are reported, including the 3D
                                                    hierarchical modeling technique, the integrated database structure,
                                                    and the interactive method of visualization of the 3D data of urban
                                                    environments. The effective integrated data organization strategy
                                                    for dynamical loading and progressive rendering, which enables CCGIS
                                                    to support the development, design and presentation of a large
                                                    CyberCity, is stressed. A pilot application for municipal planning
                                                    and land information publications has been implemented. This pilot
                                                    application proved that the hierarchical 3D modeling method and data
                                                    model are significant to the 3D GIS; the real-time visualization of
                                                    a large CyberCity needs elaborate data organization and a dynamic
                                                    loading strategy.</p>

                                                <h4>Abstract</h4>

                                                <p>
                                                    Large-scale 3D models are the cutting edge of computer technology
                                                    for understanding and planning our urban environments and
                                                    infrastructures. These models have emerged from two modelling
                                                    structures — systems for architecture, engineering, and construction
                                                    (AEC) and geographic information systems (GIS). The problems and
                                                    challenges facing today’s modelers, developed for different
                                                    purposes, focus almost exclusively on data integration — the ability
                                                    to use data originally developed in one modeling system in the other
                                                    and vice versa. This need for data transportability is not new, as
                                                    evidenced by several authors in this volume. What is new is the
                                                    desire to go beyond various conversion programs into an environment
                                                    where data is truly integrated, where the modeling framework is more
                                                    universal, and where data standards cut across software programs and
                                                    vendor-specific platforms.<br/>

                                                    This book captures the excitement of researchers, organizations, and
                                                    vendors in this quest. The border between data structures used
                                                    within GIS and AEC continues to diminish. As these two principal
                                                    forms of modeling continue to merge, as the result of increased
                                                    interest in large-scale 3D models, the need for data structures
                                                    capable of supporting both types of modeling efforts, as well as new
                                                    types of modeling efforts that combine the best features of both
                                                    simple efforts, is manifest.</p>

                                                    When disaster occurs, the response phase is viewed as the most
                                                    critical in terms of saving lives and protecting property. Exploring

                                                <p>城市化是一个国家经济发展的重要标志。据联合国《世界城市化展望： 2003年回顾》发布的数字，2003
                                                    年世界人口已有48%居住在城市，预计在2007年将达到50%以上，历史上第一次超过农村人口。我国国家统计局最近发布的结果，2003年有40.53%的人口居住在城市，与1990年同项数据18.96%相比，可以看出我国城市化的进程是逐步加快的，发展迅猛。这一方面反映了我国经济的快速增长，另一方面也对我国城市建设及相关的配套设施与政策法规提出了严峻的挑战。面对如此紧迫的形势，加快城市建设信息化的步伐将是解决城市化过程中所出现的各种新老问题的有效办法。<br>

                                                    　　城市信息化的通俗解释就是建设“数字城市”。它是要构建一个以城市地理空间（Geospace）数据和专题数据为基础，以网络计算和通信为工具，协助“人”来更有效地认识、规划、建设和管理城市，也为“人”的生存、工作、生活和安全提供保障的科技、人文环境。<br/>

                                                    　　朱庆、林珲二位教授的《数码城市地理信息系统》一书的出版正是应对城市信息化建设的新形势，解决“数字城市”建设中的理论与技术问题，并预见城市信息化前景的一本非常及时的专著。作者在城市地理信息系统的概念、原理和方法上设置了一个十分确切的解释空间，搭建了一个建立数字城市地理信息系统的认知框架，并将多年来国内外同行们在这一领域所取得的丰硕成果经过分析、评价之后融入其中。为我们提供了一条能直接而便捷地进入领域核心地带的途径。<br/>

                                                    　　这本书还反映了作者及其团队多年来的科研成果和经验，特别是在数字城市理论方法的深化过程中提出的空间建模、多维分析、数据质量控制等方面的见解，都有很强的启发性和指导意义。<br/>

                                                    　　“数字城市”既是目标，也是一个过程。最终要达到什么样的境界目前还说不太清楚。但是可以肯定的说它不是一个单纯的技术系统，而是一个“以人为本”，人机结合的大型综合集成体系。本书在这个问题上的描述有明显的特色和亮点，尽管国内外的研究探索只是刚刚起步，但方向是清晰的，应该引起我们的重视。例如，书中提出的构建分布式的虚拟地理环境，开始强调人与虚拟环境的交互与关系；讨论了地理协同（
                                                    Geocollaboration）理论在分布式虚拟地理环境中的应用，这必然会引出认知主体和客体，虚拟与实在（
                                                    Reality）等跨计算机、心理学和哲学的多种问题，并将引导“数字城市”研究与开发的深化。<br/>

                                                    　　在全球化的网格（Grid）技术的新环境中，城市信息化建设将有新的思路和新的举措。本书可以为这一即将到来的新变革打下一个稳固的基础。感谢作者多年的工作及在地理信息科学的学术交流方面所做的努力和贡献。

                                                <h4>前言</h4>

                                                <p>
                                                    城市在这个星球上的出现已经有了五千多年的历史。然而，大规模城市化是过去一百多年中发生的事情。城市的发展是与创新分不开的，这里不仅是指科技方面的创新，也包括文化方面的创新。例如，云南丽江古城凭借文化创新也迎来了发展的机会。近二十年来，城市信息化似乎成为许多中国城市发展的创新契机，并被冠以“数字城市”建设的美喻。与此同时，我们也应该看到城市本身的发展对于城市信息化也提出了挑战。譬如，珠江三角洲和长江三角洲城市群的协调发展，也呼唤出“城市群地理信息系统”的新思路。<br/>

                                                    　　近年来，受到“数字地球”（digital earth）概念的影响，“数字城市”（digital
                                                    city）在不同的认识层次和学科领域得到了不同的理解，因而具有两层明显不同的含义：广义上被用于描述城市信息化的目标，而狭义上则主要指城市空间信息基础设施。不管如何理解，城市地理信息系统都是其重要的核心内容，并正在积极向动态、多维和网络化方向发展。为了突出虚拟现实技术在城市空间信息交流方面的重要意义，“虚拟城市”（virtual
                                                    city）也被用于描述通常由三维场景组成的城市地区，用户能够在里面移动和交互。<br/>

                                                    　　城市逼真的三维数字表示由于其在城市基础设施管理、无线通讯网络规划、城市开发决策支持、污染分布仿真、土木工程与军事行动支持等众多领域显现出巨大的应用潜力，从而成为普遍关注的热点问题。如何从二维地理信息系统向城市环境三维描述（三维地理信息系统）转变正日益成为城市数据管理的时髦问题。城市的三维逼真描述——三维城市模型不仅具有传统虚拟现实表现的高度真实感，而且具有三维GIS数据库管理与分析应用等特殊功能并能与其他社会经济信息互联。因此，三维城市模型常被作为CyberCity的代名词，有关其数据获取与管理的研究受到了广泛重视。格林（Gruen）等学者将三维城市模型数据库系统称为“CyberCity
                                                    Spatial Information
                                                    System”（CyberCity空间信息系统）。针对城市地理环境应用，笔者认为CyberCity Geographic
                                                    Information System(CyberCity
                                                    GIS)的提法更为恰当，并将其翻译为数码城市地理信息系统。我们认为，数码城市地理信息系统是“数字城市”空间数据基础设施的重要组成部分，也是“虚拟城市”的核心内容；同时，也将其作为GIS向“虚拟地理环境”（virtual
                                                    geographic
                                                    environment）方向发展的一个初步原型。因此，本书以“数码城市地理信息系统——虚拟城市环境之三维城市模型初探”作为书名。<br/>

                                                    　　尽管有关三维城市模型的研究与实践在国内外已经十分广泛，但大多数成果由于立足于特定的有限领域而且都还是分散的、不全面的。比如，广泛应用于城市规划设计评价和旅游目的的各种“虚拟城市”往往侧重于其逼真的视觉表现，而忽略了可靠的空间数据获取方法和灵活的海量数据管理与分析能力。本书力图比较全面地论述当今国内外关于数码城市地理信息系统最先进的理念和研究进展，从摄影测量与遥感和地理信息工程的角度着重论述三维城市模型的数据内容与数据快速获取方法，多种类型数据的一体化管理与集成应用，海量数据的动态交互式可视化等关键技术，为我国正在开展的城市数字化工程建设提供必要的理论铺垫和技术支持。相比其他领域，城市问题具有特别的复杂性，其对
                                                    GIS技术提出了更高的要求。因此，本书关于数码城市地理信息系统的理论方法和关键技术对数字化国土、数字化战场环境和地下工程等其他相关领域的应用实践也具有一定的适用性。同时，本书集中反应了数码城市地理信息系统平台软件CCGIS4.0（2003年度国产GIS软件测评推荐软件）研发和大量工程应用实践的成果，争取在理论研究及技术应用两方面均获得发展和创新，体现先进性、系统性、实用性和可操作性的时代要求。当然，由于研究工作的局限，有关虚拟城市环境的其他问题如时态、城市人文环境等还有待在今后的版本中予以充实。书中的许多观点也期待进一步更加广泛的争论。<br/>

                                                    　　本书的完成还得到了许多人直接或间接的无私贡献。有关数码城市地理信息系统的研究与实践一直得到了武汉大学李德仁院士和龚建雅教授的关心与支持。李德仁院士在百忙中审阅了书稿，提出了宝贵的建议并给予了鼓励。解放军信息工程大学高俊院士不顾繁忙的学术活动亲自审阅全书并欣然作序，使本书增色许多，令作者深受鼓舞。要感谢测绘遥感信息工程国家重点实验室（武汉大学）和地球信息科学联合实验室（香港中文大学）有关的教师、博士研究生和硕士研究生们给予的极大支持。在几年前首次策划本书内容时，香港理工大学的李志林教授提出了许多宝贵的意见和建议，它们已经体现在今天的书稿当中。作者要感谢眭海刚博士，吴波、赵杰、黄铎、张霞、胡海棠、王静文、韩李涛、李逢春、龚俊、张叶廷、钟正等博士研究生，高玉荣和周艳等硕士研究生的辛勤付出。同时，作者还要感谢香港裘搓基金会赞助朱庆在香港中文大学地球信息科学联合实验室的访问和学术交流，使其有机会与龚建华研究员、辛晓红博士、沈大勇博士、孔云峰博士、杨育彬博士、李响、赵一斌、施晶晶和王纲胜等博士研究生进行深入讨论，并有颇多收益。本书得到了国家973项目“虚拟现实的基础理论、算法及其实现”（2002CB312101）、

                                                <h4>序言</h4>

                                                <p>数字化是在本世纪
                                                    50年代电子计算机出现后才提出的新概念，而数字高程模型（DEM）的概念在1958年就已经提出了。到了今天，数字高程模型作为地球表面地形的数字描述和模拟已成为空间数据基础设施和“数字地球”的重要组成部分。几十年来对数字高程模型的研究始终方兴未艾、十分活跃。从1972年起国际摄影测量与遥感学会（ISPRS）一直把
                                                    DEM作为主题、组织工作组进行国际性合作研究。<br/>

                                                    　　尽管有关DEM的论著和论文非常之多，但是，当我读到由李志林和朱庆写的这本书时，我仍然激动不已，一口气把它读完。我为这本书中的理论创造性、方法的实用性和对数字化生产的指导性而兴奋，中国的地球空间信息学后继有人！<br/>

                                                    　　本书用简洁的语言，有条理地、系统而全面地论述了数字高程模型的概念、数据获取、建模方法、精度分析模型等。书中对由格网数据建立DEM的表面精度所作的深入分析和对DEM精度与格网间隔及等高距关系的分析具有理论创造性，是本书的一闪光点。<br/>

                                                    　　为了推动DEM数据库的建立，作者集中力量对数字高程模型生产的质量控制、数据组织和高程内插方法进行了深入分析，并介绍了生产中的项目设计和数据库建库方法，这些叙述是基于作者在“九五”国家测绘局重点科技攻关项目中的实际工作和调查研究得到的结果，具有实际推广应用价值。<br/>

                                                    　　对于DEM的应用，本书侧重介绍了数字地形分析、可视化和在土木工程、水利工程、环境工程及GIS中的应用。这些论述对推动DEM在各领域的应用，乃至在“数字地球”中的应用有实际意义。<br/>

                                                    　　可喜的是本书的主要研究成果已在吉奥之星（GeoStar）GIS软件中得以实现，相应的软件模块GeoTIN和GeoGrid已在我国“七大江河”1：10000DEM和全国1：50000DEM数据库建立中立下功劳，成为1999年国家科技部的推荐软件。<br/>

                                                    　　基于以上的理由，我愿向广大读者，包括科研、教学、生产和管理方面的读者推荐这本书。长江后浪推前浪，江山代有人才出！也希望本书的作者们不断努力，创造更大的辉煌！

                                                <h4>前言</h4>

                                                <p>
                                                    数字地形模拟是针对地形地貌的一种数字建模过程，这种建模的结果通常就是一个数字高程模型（DEM）。自从五十年代后期开始被用于公路设计以来，DEM受到了极大的关注，并在测绘土木工程、地质、矿山工程、景观建筑、道路设计、防洪、农业、规划、军事工程、飞行器与战场仿真等领域得到了广泛应用。<br/>

                                                    　　随着科学技术特别是计算技术和空间技术的迅速发展，在DEM的数据获取方法、数据存储和数据处理速度等方面已经取得突破性进展，数字地形模拟已经成为地球科学重要的分支之一。实际上，由于地理信息系统（GIS）的普及，DEM作为数字地形模拟的重要成果已经成为国家空间数据基础设施（NSDI）的基本内容之一，并被纳入数字化空间数据框架（DGDF）进行规模化生产。今天，数字高程模型DEMs已经成为独立的标准的基础产品，并越来越广泛地被用来代替传统地形图中等高线对地形的描述。显然，跟过去提供等高线地形图一样，提供DEMs也已成为各勘测部门的基本任务和日常工作之一。全国范围内的DEMs等价于中小比例尺的基本地形图，而其他大比例尺、高精度的DEMs则与更大比例尺的地形图相当。这些高精度DEMs无疑将由更多的地方或专业部门提供。随着各种精度级别DEMs的普遍可得，过去许多潜在的应用领域现在已经变成十分重要的用户。DEMs作为地球空间框架数据的基本内容，是各种地理信息的载体，在国家空间数据基础设施的建设和数字地球战略的实施进程中都具有十分重要的作用。为了推动DEMs的生产和应用，有必要推出一本内容翔实涉及面广的著作。换句话说，经过40來年的发展，DEMs的理论基础和涉及的主要技术方法都已经成熟，这些理论与技术应该被归纳总结到这样的书中，这也是作者们致力于该项工程的主要原因。<br/>

                                                    　　综合作者们十多年来在该领域的研究开发成果、汇集国内外最新的理论与技术成就，我们推出了这本著作。本书首次系统全面地论述了DEMs的概念、数据源、数据获取、建模方法、精度模型、质量控制、数字分析、可视化与应用等基本理论与关键技术，并介绍了实用的生产项目设计和数据库建设的方法。其中，绝大部分内容都是经过作者实际工作考察和对比分析后取得的成果，具有较强的针对性和应用参考价值，许多先进的技术方法都已体现在吉奥之星（GeoStar）地理信息系统系列软件中，并在生产实践中得到了广泛采用。本书力求能为与地学相关学科的各类专业技术（管理）人员进行科学研究、教学、生产和管理等工作提供较完整实用的理论依据与技术参考。<br/>

                                                    　　本书是在中国科学院和中国工程院院士、测绘遥感信息工程国家重点实验室主任李德仁教授的热情鼓励和指导下完成的。承蒙他在百忙中审阅全书并作序，特此表示深深的敬意和感谢。感谢测绘遥感信息工程国家重点实验室常务副主任、首批“长江学者奖励计划”特聘教授龚健雅博士审阅全书并提出宝贵意见。
                                                    感谢研究生周艳、高玉荣和王丽圆同学在资料整理过程中付出的大量艰辛劳动。
                                                    我们也非常感谢武汉大学出版社把本书作为她的“数字地球丛书”之一跟读者见面。</p>
